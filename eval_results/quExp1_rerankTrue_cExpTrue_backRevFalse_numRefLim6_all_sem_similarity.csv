What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,There is no mention of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma in the provided contexts.," Context:  canSAR (http://cansar.icr.ac.uk) is a public integrative cancer-focused  knowledgebase for the support of cancer translational research and drug  discovery. Through the integration of biological, pharmacological, chemical, structural biology and protein network data, it provides a single information  portal to answer complex multidisciplinary questions including--among many  others--what is known about a protein, in which cancers is it expressed or mutated, and what chemical tools and cell line models can be used to  experimentally probe its activity? What is known about a drug, its cellular  sensitivity profile and what proteins is it known to bind that may explain  ,  Context:  Medulloblastoma (MB) is a malignant brain tumor that arises in the cerebellum of  children. Activation of the Sonic hedgehog/Patched (Shh/Ptc) signaling pathway  in neural progenitor cells of the cerebellum induces MBs in mice. The incomplete penetrance of tumor formation in mice, coupled with the low frequency of  mutations in Shh/Ptc pathway genes in human tumors, suggests that other  signaling molecules cooperate with Shh to enhance MB formation. We modeled the ability of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling to induce MB using the  RCAS/tv-a system, which allows postnatal gene transfer and expression in a  cell-type-specific manner. We used RCAS retroviral vectors to target expression  ,  Context:  Medulloblastoma is a malignant tumor that arises in the cerebellum in children,  presumably by transformation of granule neuron precursor cells. In vivo models  of medulloblastoma in genetically engineered mice have shown that activation of signal transduction pathways that stimulate proliferation and inhibit  differentiation of neural progenitor cells during cerebellar development  initiate medulloblastoma formation. Activation of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh)/Patched signaling pathway in the postnatal cerebellum is sufficient to  induce medulloblastoma in mice. Activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase  (PI3K) signaling pathway by insulin-like growth factor-II, inactivation of the  ,  Context:  Medulloblastoma (MDB) is the most common malignant cerebellar tumor in children.  Because of the significant rate of mortality and treatment-related morbidity,  the identification of prognostic factors could lead to a more accurate selection of patients who can benefit from a less aggressive therapy and improve risk  stratification. Survivin is an inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP), the  expression of which has been associated with worse prognosis in MDB. However, both of its subcellular localizations may contribute to tumor progression, and  ultimately, survivin subcellular localization prognostic value depends on tumor  type biological features. The goal of this study was to analyze these survivin  ,  Context:  Medulloblastomas are malignant brain tumors that arise in the cerebellum in  children. Aberrant activation of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway,  which normally stimulates proliferation of granule neuron precursors (GNP) during cerebellar development, induces tumors in mice that closely mimic human  medulloblastomas. Shh-dependent medulloblastoma formation is enhanced by  hyperactive insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling and ectopic expression of Myc oncogenes. This enhanced tumorigenesis stems from the sensitivity of GNPs to  IGF and Myc levels in regulating proliferation. An emerging theme in cancer  research is that oncogene-induced cell proliferation cannot initiate neoplastic  ,  Context: glutamatergic synapses, activation of which results in prolonged bursts of  action potentials in the postsynaptic UBC. The axons of UBCs themselves form  mossy fiber contacts with other UBCs and granule cells, forming an excitatory,  intrinsic cerebellar network that has the capacity to synchronize and amplify  mossy fiber inputs to potentially large populations of granule cells. In this  paper, we demonstrate that UBCs in rat cerebellar slices express low voltage  activated (LVA) fast-inactivating and high voltage activated (HVA) slowly  inactivating calcium channels. LVA calcium currents are mediated by T-type  calcium channels and they are associated with calcium increases in the dendrites and to a lesser extent the cell soma. HVA currents, mediated by L-type calcium  channels, are slowly inactivating and they produce larger overall increases in  intracellular calcium but with a similar distribution pattern. We review these observations alongside several recent papers that examine how intrinsic membrane  properties influence UBCs firing patterns and we discuss how UBC signaling may  affect downstream cerebellar processing.

Smoking can impact on Th17  lymphocyte differentiation and function through activation of the aryl  hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a process with implications for the pathogenic  mechanisms in RA that involve the cytokine, interleukin (IL)-17A. The objective  of this study was to establish any effect of smoking on the inflammatory tissue lesions of rheumatoid arthritis via the AHR and IL-17A. METHODS: Twenty synovial and eighteen subcutaneous nodule tissue samples from 31  patients with RA were studied. Patient smoking status at the time of tissue collection was established.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies are characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies. They are accompanied by subcortical multisystem degeneration with neuronal loss and gliosis with or without Alzheimer pathologic state.," Context:  Protein aggregation within the central nervous system has been recognized as a  defining feature of neurodegenerative diseases since the early 20th century.  Since that time, there has been a growing list of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson disease, which are characterized by inclusions of specific  pathogenic proteins. This has led to the long-held dogma that these  characteristic protein inclusions, which are composed of large insoluble fibrillar protein aggregates and visible by light microscopy, are responsible  for cell death in these diseases. However, the correlation between protein  inclusion formation and cytotoxicity is inconsistent, suggesting that another  ,  Context: activities. Arimoclomol is a co-activator that prolongs the binding of activated  HSF1 to heat shock elements (HSEs) in the promoter regions of inducible Hsp  genes. Elevated Hsp levels peaked at 10 to 12 h for HSPA6, HSPA1A, DNAJB1, and  HO-1 and at 24 h for HSPB1. Co-application of celastrol and arimoclomol induced  higher Hsp levels compared to heat shock paired with arimoclomol. The  co-application strategy of celastrol and arimoclomol targets multiple  neurodegenerative disease-associated pathologies including protein misfolding  and protein aggregation, inflammatory and oxidative stress, and synaptic  dysfunction.  ,  Context: One of the most important contributions to our understanding of  neurodegenerative diseases in the last decade has been the demonstration that  several disorders have a common biochemical cause, involving aggregation and  deposition of abnormal proteins. Abnormal protein deposition leads to neuronal  degeneration with consequences to impaired brain function. Protein deposition  can be extracellular (beta-amyloid peptide (A beta), prion protein) or intracellular (Tau, alpha-synuclein, huntingtin). Individuals with Alzheimer's  disease (AD) exhibit extracellular senile plaques (SPs) of aggregated A beta and  intracellular neurofibrillary tangles that contain hyperphosphorylated Tau protein (NFTs), and also an extensive loss in basal forebrain cholinergic  neurons that innervate the hippocampus and neocortex. The SPs and NFTs  contribute to neurodegeneration, although the mechanisms inducing basal  ,  Context: Notch-1 is a protein that influences cell fate decisions, with its expression  occurring primarily during embryogenesis and development. However, Notch-1 is  also expressed in the adult brain, in regions with high synaptic plasticity,  particularly the hippocampus. Its role in adults is unknown; however, it may  impact neurite outgrowth or cell differentiation in adult brain regions  undergoing neurogenesis. Notch-1 is increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD);  however, its expression in other CNS degenerative diseases has not been  described. To begin to define the range of degenerative disorders where Notch-1  expression is altered, we examined Notch-1 immunoreactivity in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases to determine whether its increase is selective for  AD. We examined sections of hippocampus from 13 AD, 13 classical Pick's disease  (PiD; with Pick bodies), 4 dementia lacking distinctive histopathology (DLDH) and 8 control brains, emphasizing hippocampal (dentate gyrus) pathology. We  determined that Notch-1 immunoexpression is increased in AD and PiD relative to  control cases. DLDH cases were not significantly different than control cases  ,  Context: pathological diagnosis of Lewy body disorders and dementia with Lewy bodies is  established by validated consensus criteria based on semiquantitative assessment  of subcortical and cortical Lewy bodies as their common hallmarks. They are  accompanied by subcortical multisystem degeneration with neuronal loss and  gliosis with or without Alzheimer pathologic state. Lewy bodies also occur in  numerous other disorders, including pure autonomic failure, neuroaxonal  dystrophies, and various amyloidoses and tauopathies.

The NoSAS Score can be used for screening of which disorders?,The NoSAS score can be used for screening of Sleep-Disordered Breathing (SDB) and Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS).," Context: RESULTS: A total of 450 patients were included in the study. The sensitivity,  specificity, PPV, and NPV of the NoSAS score were 81%, 51.2%, 88.2%, and 37.5%  for an AHI (apnea–hypopnea index) ≥ 5 event/h and 84.5%, 38.2%, 66%, and 63.4%  for an AHI ≥ 15 event/h, respectively. AUC percentages for the NoSAS score,  STOP-Bang questionnaire, Berlin questionnaire, and ESS were 0.740, 0.737, 0.626,  and 0.571 for an AHI ≥ 5 events/h and 0.715, 0.704, 0.574, and 0.621 for an AHI  ≥ 30 events/h. The NoSAS score had a false negative rate of 2.9% for severe SDB. CONCLUSION: The NoSAS score had a good degree of differentiation for SDB and can  be used as an easily applicable, subjective, and effective screening tool in a sleep clinical population in Turkey. Not only in moderate to severe SDB but also  in mild SDB, the NoSAS score performed better than the other 3 screening tools.  ,  Context: current MDE.

We aimed to develop a screening tool allowing identification of  individuals at risk of sleep-disordered breathing. METHODS: We used the participants from the population-based HypnoLaus cohort in  Lausanne, Switzerland, who had a clinical assessment and polysomnography at  home, to build a clinical score (the NoSAS score) using multiple factor analysis  and logistic regression to identify people likely to have clinically significant  sleep-disordered breathing.

All species of the genus Takifugu accumulate TTX in the liver and ovaries,  although the tissue(s) in which it is localized can differ among species. TTX is the major defense strategy the pufferfish appears to use against predators. TTX  is also used as a male-attracting pheromone during spawning. Here we demonstrate  an additional (and unexpected) use of maternal TTX in the early larval stages of the Takifugu pufferfish. Predation experiments demonstrated that juveniles of  all the species of fish used as predators ingested pufferfish larvae, but spat  them out promptly.

In these situations, adaptation should commonly  produce 'soft' selective sweeps, where multiple adaptive alleles sweep through  the population at the same time, either because the alleles were already present  as standing genetic variation or arose independently by recurrent de novo mutations. Most well-known examples of rapid molecular adaptation indeed show  signatures of such soft selective sweeps. Here, we review the current  understanding of the mechanisms that produce soft sweeps and the approaches used for their identification in population genomic data. We argue that soft sweeps  might be the dominant mode of adaptation in many species.  ,  Context:  Selective sweeps are typically associated with a local reduction of genetic  diversity around the adaptive site. However, selective sweeps can also quickly  carry neutral mutations to observable population frequencies if they arise early in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the interplay  between mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking results in a  characteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype variation that depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection  coefficient of the sweep. On the basis of this result, we develop an estimator  for the selection coefficient driving a sweep.

Because adipose  tissue inflammation accompanied by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines  is characteristic for the development of obesity, we hypothesized that  modulation of autophagy alters adipose tissue inflammatory gene expression and  secretion. We tested our hypothesis using ex vivo and in vivo studies of human  and mouse adipose tissue. Levels of the autophagy marker LC3 were elevated in sc  adipose tissue of obese vs. lean human subjects and positively correlated to both systemic insulin resistance and morphological characteristics of adipose  tissue inflammation. Similarly, autophagic activity levels were increased in  adipose tissue of obese and insulin resistant animals as compared with lean mice.

A screen for small molecule modulators for  aggrephagy identified ERRα inverse agonist XCT 790, that cleared α-synuclein aggregates in an autophagy dependent, but mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR)  independent manner. XCT 790 modulates autophagosome formation in an ERRα  dependent manner as validated by siRNA mediated knockdown and over expression approaches.

Emerging roles in diverse biological processes  suggest that circRNA is a promising key player in RNA world. Most circRNAs are  generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, forming a covalently closed loop  structure with no 5' caps or 3' polyadenylated tails. In addition, most circRNAs  were not associated with translating ribosomes, therefore, circRNAs were deemed  to be noncoding. However, the latest research findings revealed that some  circRNAs could generate proteins in vivo, which expands the landscape of  transcriptome and proteome.

Proteolytic maturation of this precursor protein is  performed by the proteasome complex. Here we show that Tax binds specifically to  two subunits of the 20S proteasome, HsN3 and HC9. This interaction is weakened  with HsN3 and lost for HC9 when a mutant of Tax is substituted that is  selectively defective for NF-kappa B activation. Immunoprecipitation shows that  p1O5 binds weakly to HC9 and that this interaction is reinforced by Tax. No bridging function of Tax between p1O5 and HsN3 was observed. From these results,  we propose that Tax accelerates the proteolytic maturation of P105 by favouring  its anchorage to the proteasome.  ,  Context: METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and oncology conference proceedings were searched for  relevant studies. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials of cancer  patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors with adequate data on hepatic AEs.  RESULTS: A total of nine randomized controlled trials with a variety of solid  tumors were eligible for the meta-analysis. The use of PD-1 inhibitors  significantly increased the risk of developing all-grade hepatic AEs but not for  high-grade hepatic AEs in comparison with chemotherapy or everolimus control.  Additionally, the risk of all-grade and high-grade hepatic AEs with a  nivolumab/ipilimumab combination was substantially higher than ipilimumab. No significant differences in the risk of all-grade and high-grade hepatic AEs were  found between PD-1 inhibitors monotherapy and ipilimumab. CONCLUSION: While the use of PD-1 inhibitors is associated with an increased risk of developing hepatic AEs in cancer patients, this is primarily for lower  grade events.  ,  Context: II/III trials for psoriasis and PsA.

A literature  search identified clinical trials examining the efficacy and safety of  bimekizumab for psoriasis and PsA, and these were critically appraised. EXPERT OPINION: Clinical trials of bimekizumab have been promising,  demonstrating a rapid onset of response and superior efficacy compared to three  currently licensed biologics: secukinumab, ustekinumab, and adalimumab.  Bimekizumab maintains a high level of efficacy with maintenance dosing intervals  of 8 weeks, compared with 4 weeks for currently licensed IL-17A antagonists. No unexpected adverse events have been identified, although mild-to-moderate fungal  infections occur in approximately 10%.

It usually occurs in soft tissues, muscles, tendons, and subperiosteal part of the bones. It slowly enlarges, develops a fibrous capsule, and destroys  underlying tissues by progressive necrosis (James et al., 2003). Hemophilia is  an X chromosome-linked hereditary disorder caused by defective synthesis or synthesis of dysfunctional factor VIII molecules (Harold et al., 2006).  ,  Context:  Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare lesion that is essentially a progressive,  slowly expanding, encapsulated hematoma.

Changes in mTOR activity are often observed in nervous system diseases,  including genetic diseases (e.g., tuberous sclerosis complex, Pten-related  syndromes, neurofibromatosis, and Fragile X syndrome), epilepsy, brain tumors,  ,  Context: Finding genes associated with a disease is an important issue in the biomedical  area and many gene prioritization methods have been proposed for this goal.  Among these, network-based approaches are recently proposed and outperformed  functional annotation-based ones. Here, we introduce a novel Cytoscape plug-in,  GPEC, to help identify putative genes likely to be associated with specific  diseases or pathways. In the plug-in, gene prioritization is performed through a  random walk with restart algorithm, a state-of-the art network-based method,  along with a gene/protein relationship network. The plug-in also allows users  efficiently collect biomedical evidence for highly ranked candidate genes. A set of known genes, candidate genes and a gene/protein relationship network can be  provided in a flexible way.  ,  Context: transplantation, we found that mTORC1 in nonhematopoietic cells played a major  role in protecting mice from colitis.

GC signaling follows several consecutive steps  leading to target gene transactivation, including ligand binding, nuclear  translocation of ligand-activated GR complexes, DNA binding, and recruitment of  functional transcriptional machinery. Generalized glucocorticoid resistance  syndrome, due to GR loss-of-function mutations, may be related to the impairment  of one of the GC signaling steps. To date, 31 NR3C1 loss-of-function mutations  have been reported in patients presenting with various clinical signs such as  hypertension, adrenal hyperplasia, hirsutism or metabolic disorders associated  with biological hypercortisolism but without Cushing syndrome signs and no negative regulatory feedback loop on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.  Functional characterization of GR loss-of-function mutations often demonstrates  GR haploinsufficiency and a decrease of GR target gene induction in relevant cell types.

Six different dnmt3 genes have  recently been identified in zebrafish. RESULTS: We have examined two of the dnmt3 genes in zebrafish that are located  in close proximity in the same linkage group and we find that the two genes are  more similar to each other than they are to the other zebrafish dnmt3 genes. We  have found evidence for the existence of several different splice variants and  alternative splice sites associated with one of the two genes and have examined  the relative expression of these genes/variants in a number of zebrafish  developmental stages and tissues. CONCLUSION: The similarity of the dnmt3-1 and dnmt3-2 genes suggests that they  arose due to a relatively recent gene duplication event. The presence of  alternative splice and start sites, reminiscent of what is seen with the human DNMT3s, demonstrates strong parallels between the control/function of these  genes across vertebrate species. The dynamic expression levels of these  genes/variants suggest that they may well play a role in early development and  ,  Context: The post-transcriptional fate of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) is largely dictated by  their 3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs), which are defined by cleavage and  polyadenylation (CPA) of pre-mRNAs.

CMT1A is a form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, the most common  inherited disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Mutations in CMT related disorder are seen to increase the stability of the protein resulting in the  diseased state. We performed SNP analysis for all the nsSNPs of PMP22 protein  and carried out molecular dynamics simulation for T118M mutation to compare the stability difference between the wild type protein structure and the mutant  protein structure. The mutation T118M resulted in the overall increase in the  stability of the mutant protein. The superimposed structure shows marked  ,  Context:  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease caused by mutations in the GDAP1 gene has been  shown to be inherited via traits that may be either autosomal recessive (in the  majority of cases) [CMT4A] or autosomal dominant [CMT2K]. CMT4A disease is characterized by an early onset, and a severe clinical course often leading to a  loss of ambulation, whereas CMT2K is characterized by a mild clinical course of  benign axonal neuropathy beginning even in the 6th decade of life. Clinical data from a GDAP1 mutated patient suggests that the presence of a particular mutation  is associated with a certain trait of inheritance. The association of a  particular GDAP1 gene mutation and a dominant or recessive trait of inheritance  ,  Context:  Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) diseases include a group of clinically heterogeneous  inherited neuropathies subdivided into demyelinating (CMT1), axonal (CMT2) and  intermediate CMT forms. CMTs are associated with different genes, although mutations in some of these genes may cause both clinical pictures. To date, more  than 50 CMT genes have been identified, but more than half of the cases are due  to mutations in MFN2, MPZ, GJB1 and PMP22. The aim of this study was to estimate the frequency of disease mutations of these four genes in the axonal form of CMT  in order to evaluate their effectiveness in the molecular diagnosis of CMT2  patients.

Different chromosomal loci have been linked  with three autosomal dominant, 'intermediate' types of CMT: DI-CMTA, DI-CMTB and DI-CMTC. We refined the locus associated with DI-CMTB on chromosome 19p12-13.2  to 4.2 Mb in three unrelated families with CMT originating from Australia,  Belgium and North America. After screening candidate genes, we identified unique mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2) in all families. DNM2 belongs to the family of  large GTPases and is part of the cellular fusion-fission apparatus. In  transiently transfected cell lines, mutations of DNM2 substantially diminish  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVE: Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT) forms a clinically and genetically  heterogeneous group of disorders. Although a number of disease genes have been  identified for CMT, the gene discovery for some complex form of CMT has lagged behind. The association of neuropathy and optic atrophy (also known as CMT type  6) has been described with autosomaldominant, recessive and X-linked modes of  inheritance. Mutations in Mitofusin 2 have been found to cause dominant forms of CMT6. Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase-I mutations cause X-linked CMT6,  but until now, mutations in the recessive forms of disease have never been  identified.

Clinical features of CMT1A include  progressive distal muscle atrophy and weakness, foot and hand deformities, gait  abnormalities, absent reflexes, and the completely penetrant electrophysiologic phenotype of symmetric reductions in motor nerve conduction velocities (NCVs).  Molecular and fluorescense in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses were performed  to determine the duplication status of the PMP22 gene in four patients with rare cytogenetic duplications of 17p.

Pump-probe experimental techniques which observe the temporal  evolution of systems after optical or x-ray pulse excitation are one of the main  experimental schemes currently in use for ultrafast studies. The key challenge in these experiments is to reliably achieve temporal and spatial overlap of the  x-ray and optical pulses. Here we present measurements of the x-ray pulse  induced transient change of optical reflectivity from a variety of materials  ,  Context:  A growing number of X-ray sources based on the free-electron laser (XFEL)  principle are presently under construction or have recently started operation.  The intense, ultrashort pulses of these sources will enable new insights in many different fields of science. A key problem is to provide x-ray optical elements  capable of collecting the largest possible fraction of the radiation and to  focus into the smallest possible focus. As a key step towards this goal, we demonstrate here the first nanofocusing of hard XFEL pulses. We developed  diamond based Fresnel zone plates capable of withstanding the full beam of the  world's most powerful x-ray laser.

It involves forebrain and facial malformations that can  range from mild to severe. The epidemiology of holoprosencephaly is largely  unknown. Published prevalence estimates have been derived from clinic-based case  series, and suggested risk factors for holoprosencephaly have been identified in  case reports, without confirmation from systematically conducted population-based studies. Using data from a population-based birth defects  registry in California, we describe the epidemiologic and clinical  characteristics of cytogenetically and phenotypically distinct types of holoprosencephaly. A total of 121 cases was identified among a cohort of  1,035,386 live births and fetal deaths. The prevalence of holoprosencephaly was  1.2 per 10,000 births (95% confidence interval 1.0-1.4 per 10,000). Of all  ,  Context:  PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Holoprosencephaly is a disorder of forebrain development  characterized by a failure of the brain to separate into two hemispheres during  early development. It is now clear that many cases of holoprosencephaly are caused by alterations in the genetic programmes that pattern the nervous system.  Less is known about how a holoprosencephalic brain either forms or fails to form  connections between various brain structures.

Here we present 5 patients with clear phenotypic  signs of microform holoprosencephaly, all of whom have evidence of above-average  intellectual function. In 4 of these 5 individuals, the molecular cause of  holoprosencephaly has been identified and includes mutations affecting SHH,  SIX3, GLI2, and FGF8.

Therapeutic chelation or endoscopic  follow-up is not recommended.  ,  Context:  Pseudomelanosis duodeni is seen endoscopically as dark spots in the duodenal  mucosa and is generally considered to be local deposition of iron from oral iron  intake. However, pseudomelanosis duodeni may be identified histologically even before it becomes endoscopically evident; iron stainability within the mucosa is  uneven and unpredictable, and multiple clinical conditions other than oral iron  intake may be associated.

Which genes are regulated by TRalpha2  in the heart?,I am uncertain about which specific genes are regulated by TRalpha2 in the heart as there is no mention of it in the provided contexts.," Context: response to increased extracellular calcium. When cocultured with mouse  cardiomyocytes, Retinoic Acid-treated skeletal muscle stem cells expressed  connexin43 and when transplanted into ischemic heart were detectable even 5  weeks after injection. Based on these results, we can conclude that human adult  skeletal muscle stem cells, if opportunely treated, can transdifferentiate into  cells of cardiac lineage and once injected into infarcted heart can integrate,  survive in cardiac tissue and improve the cardiac function.  ,  Context:  The myocardium of the failing heart undergoes a number of structural  alterations, most notably hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes and an increase in  extracellular matrix proteins, often seen as primary fibrosis. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a key molecule in the process of fibrosis and therefore  seems an attractive therapeutic target. Regulation of CTGF expression at the  promoter level has been studied extensively, but it is unknown how CTGF transcripts are regulated at the posttranscriptional level. Here we provide  several lines of evidence to show that CTGF is importantly regulated by 2 major  cardiac microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-133 and miR-30.

Cardiac functions were measured by echocardiography and cardiac tissue was harvested for immunohistological studies 3 weeks after surgery. We observed  regeneration of MSC in and around the infarcted myocardium in MSC and MSC-EPO  groups. Capillary density was markedly enhanced with significantly smaller infarct size and reduced fibrotic area in MSC-EPO group as compared with other  three groups. A smaller left ventricular (LV) diastolic dimension and a higher  LV fractional shortening were observed in MSC-EPO group than in other three  ,  Context: Sequence analysis suggested that TNNI3K is a distant family member of  integrin-linked kinase. Northern blot and 76-tissue array analyses showed that  TNNI3K is highly expressed in heart, but is undetectable in other tissues.  Immunohistochemical analysis predominantly localized TNNI3K in the nucleus of  cardiac myocytes. In vitro kinase assay showed that TNNI3K is a functional  kinase. The yeast two-hybrid system showed that TNNI3K could directly interact  with cardiac troponin I, results that were further confirmed by  coimmunoprecipitation in vivo. Our data suggest that TNNI3K is a  cardiac-specific kinase and play important roles in cardiac system.  ,  Context: catheter-tissue apposition and monitored RFA lesion formation in cardiac tissue  in real time. The results show that catheter-tissue contact can be characterized  by observing the features of the blood and tissue in the acquired OCT images and  that RFA lesion formation can be confirmed by monitoring the change in phase  retardance in the acquired PSOCT images. This system demonstrates the  feasibility of an integrated RFA/OCT catheter to deliver RF energy and image the  cardiac wall simultaneously and justifies further research into use of this  technology to aid RFA therapy for cardiac arrhythmias.  ,  Context: the DUSP5 expression in cardiac fibrosis remain largely unknown. Here, we  identify H19 negatively regulation of DUSP5 gene expression in cardiac  fibroblast and fibrosis tissues. In vivo, the expression levels of H19, DUSP5,  α-SMA, p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 in cardiac fibrosis tissue were estimated by Western  blotting, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and  immunohistochemistry. In vitro stimulation of freshly isolated rat cardiac  fibroblasts with recombinant marine TGF-β1 was performed, followed by  quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western  blotting to detect changes in H19, DUSP5, p-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 levels. Cardiac fibroblasts were transfected with pEX-3-H19 overexpressing, H19-RNAi  down-regulating, or pEGFP-C1-DUSP5 overexpressing. Finally, cell proliferation  was assessed by the MTT assay and cell cycle. H19 endogenous expression is overexpressed in cardiac fibroblast and fibrosis tissues, and an opposite  pattern is observed for DUSP5.

What is the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19?,"MIS-C is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19, initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after exposure to COVID-19. It's a disorder where inflammation can occur in different parts of the body,"," Context: With the continuation of the second wave of a novel coronavirus disease  (COVID-19), which is likely to be even more devastating, there are several  associated health problems. COVID-19 is usually mild and non-fatal in children.  However, in rare cases, children could severely be affected, and clinical  manifestations may differ from adults. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in  children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19, initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after  exposure to the COVID-19. MIS-C is a disorder in which inflammation could occur  in different parts of the body. The disease puts pressure on the heart, as blood vessels leading towards the heart get inflamed and incapable of carrying  adequate blood, hence producing cardiac complications in children hospitalised  with MIS-C. The problem seems to be associated with COVID-19 in children;  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVE: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with  coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a rare and challenging diagnosis requiring  early treatment.

Which are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation?,"MEC-17 (an α-tubulin acetyltransferase), HDAC6 (a histone deacetylase that functions as a tubulin deacetylase), and SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) are enzymes"," Context: Neuronal migration is a fundamental process during the development of the  cerebral cortex and is regulated by cytoskeletal components. Microtubule  dynamics can be modulated by posttranslational modifications to tubulin  subunits. Acetylation of α-tubulin at lysine 40 is important in regulating  microtubule properties, and this process is controlled by acetyltransferase and  deacetylase. MEC-17 is a newly discovered α-tubulin acetyltransferase that has been found to play a major role in the acetylation of α-tubulin in different  species in vivo. However, the physiological function of MEC-17 during neural  development is largely unknown. Here, we report that MEC-17 is critical for the migration of cortical neurons in the rat. MEC-17 was strongly expressed in the  cerebral cortex during development. MEC-17 deficiency caused migratory defects  in the cortical projection neurons and interneurons, and perturbed the  ,  Context: invasion is necessary for the better clinical therapy and improvements of the  patients' quality of life. Microtubules in eukaryotic cells reveal the shape of  hollow cylinders made up of polymerized alpha (α)- and beta (β)-tubulin dimers  and form the cytoskeleton together with microfilaments and intermediate  filaments. Microtubules play important roles in cell migration by undergoing  assembly and disassembly with post-translational modifications. Stability of  microtubules caused by their acetylation is involved in cell migration. In this  study, we investigated the expression and distribution of acetylated α-tubulin  and alpha-tubulin N-acetyltransferase 1 (αTAT1), an enzyme which acetylates Lys-40 in α-tubulin, in AB specimens, and analyzed how tubulin was acetylated by  αTAT1 activation in a human AB cell line, AM-1. Finally, we clarified that  TGF-β-activated kinase1 (TAK1) was phosphorylated by TGF-β stimulation, then, induced tubulin acetylation via αTAT1 activation, which subsequently activated  the migration and invasion of AB cells.  ,  Context: Reversible acetylation of alpha-tubulin has been implicated in regulating  microtubule stability and function. The distribution of acetylated alpha-tubulin  is tightly controlled and stereotypic. Acetylated alpha-tubulin is most abundant  in stable microtubules but is absent from dynamic cellular structures such as  neuronal growth cones and the leading edges of fibroblasts. However, the enzymes  responsible for regulating tubulin acetylation and deacetylation are not known. Here we report that a member of the histone deacetylase family, HDAC6, functions  as a tubulin deacetylase. HDAC6 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, where  it associates with microtubules and localizes with the microtubule motor complex containing p150(glued) (ref. 3). In vivo, the overexpression of HDAC6 leads to a  global deacetylation of alpha-tubulin, whereas a decrease in HDAC6 increases  alpha-tubulin acetylation. In vitro, purified HDAC6 potently deacetylates  ,  Context: acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Knockout studies  of the mouse enzymes have yielded new insights into biological functions of  tubulin acetylation. Abnormal levels of this modification are linked to  neurological disorders, cancer, heart diseases and other pathological  conditions, thereby yielding important therapeutic implications. This review  summarizes related studies and concludes that tubulin acetylation is important  for regulating microtubule architecture and maintaining microtubule integrity.  Together with detyrosination, glutamylation and other modifications, tubulin  acetylation may form a unique 'language' to regulate microtubule structure and  function.  ,  Context: Cytoskeleton remodelling is a prerequisite step for the morphological transition  from preadipocytes to mature adipocytes. Although microtubules play a pivotal  role in organizing cellular structure, regulation of microtubule dynamics during  adipogenesis remains unclear. In the present paper we show that acetylation of  α-tubulin is up-regulated during adipogenesis, and adipocyte development is  dependent on α-tubulin acetylation, as expression of an acetylation-resistant  α-tubulin mutant significantly inhibits adipogenesis. Moreover, acetylation of  α-tubulin is under the control of the acetyltransferase MEC-17 and deacetylases  SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6). Adipocyte development is inhibited in MEC-17-knockdown cells, but enhanced in MEC-17-overexpressing  cells. Finally, we show that katanin, a microtubule-severing protein with  enhanced activity on acetylated α-tubulin, is actively involved in adipogenesis. We propose that co-ordinated up-regulation of α-tubulin acetylation initiates  cytoskeleton remodelling by promoting α-tubulin severing by katanin which, in  turn, allows expansion of lipid droplets and accelerates the morphological  ,  Context:  The post-translational modification of tubulin appears to be a highly controlled  mechanism that regulates microtubule functioning. Acetylation of the ε-amino  group of Lys-40 of α-tubulin marks stable microtubules, although the causal relationship between tubulin acetylation and microtubule stability has remained  poorly understood. HDAC6, the tubulin deacetylase, plays a key role in  maintaining typical distribution of acetylated microtubules in cells. Here, by using tubastatin A, an HDAC6-specific inhibitor, and siRNA-mediated depletion of  HDAC6, we have explored whether tubulin acetylation has a role in regulating  microtubule stability.

As single anticancer agent, tasquinimod treatment was effective in preventing early stage tumor growth, but  did not achieve a clear antitumor effect in advanced tumors. Investigations of  this response revealed that tasquinimod induces an increase in the expression of a negative regulator of T cell activation, Programmed-death-ligand 1 (PD-L1).  This markedly weakens its antitumor immunity, yet provokes an ""inflamed"" milieu  rendering tumors more prone to T cell-mediated immune attack by PD-L1 blockade.  ,  Context: proof-of-principle of efficacy in this therapeutic class with promising early  results in both higher risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and TP53 mutant  acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The toxicity profile to date has been shown safe  and manageable with on-target anemia related to CD47 being present on aged red  blood cells and without evidence of immune related toxicities. Investigation of  novel agents targeting this pathway and novel combinations are ongoing. New  strategies targeting macrophage checkpoints are encouraging and likely will lead  a paradigm shift in the current treatment of myeloid malignancies.  ,  Context:  Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) is a promising therapeutic target for cancer  immunotherapy, while TAMs targeting therapy using nano-sized drug delivery  system (NDDS) is a great challenge. To overcome these drawbacks, a novel erythrocyte-cancer cell hybrid membrane camouflaged pH-responsive copolymer  micelle (dextran-grafted-poly (histidine) copolymer) was prepared to target  deliver a selective CSF-1R inhibitor: BLZ-945 (shorten as DH@ECm) to TAMs for TAMs depletion.

A therapeutic strategy which effectively targets  relevant and specific molecule to myeloma cells, and which is potent in  overcoming tumor microenvironment-mediated drug resistance needs to be  developed. One of the promising fields is the development of immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against myeloma-specific antigens. This review  focuses on the basic and clinical aspects of two emerging and promising novel  MoAbs for MM, elotuzumab which targets CS1 and daratumumab which targets CD38. Both antigens are relatively specific to myeloma cells and expressed in more  than 90% of MM patients, and mediate adhesion of myeloma cells to bone marrow  stromal cells.

What is measured through the NOMe-Seq methodology?,NOMe-seq measures chromatin accessibility and endogenous DNA methylation on single molecules.," Context: Gaining insights into the regulatory mechanisms that underlie the  transcriptional variation observed between individual cells necessitates the  development of methods that measure chromatin organization in single cells. Here  I adapted Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome-sequencing (NOMe-seq) to measure  chromatin accessibility and endogenous DNA methylation in single cells  (scNOMe-seq). scNOMe-seq recovered characteristic accessibility and DNA methylation patterns at DNase hypersensitive sites (DHSs). An advantage of  scNOMe-seq is that sequencing reads are sampled independently of the  accessibility measurement. scNOMe-seq therefore controlled for fragment loss, which enabled direct estimation of the fraction of accessible DHSs within  individual cells. In addition, scNOMe-seq provided high resolution of chromatin  accessibility within individual loci which was exploited to detect footprints of  ,  Context: MOTIVATION: Chromatin accessibility plays a key role in epigenetic regulation of  gene activation and silencing. Open chromatin regions allow regulatory elements  such as transcription factors and polymerases to bind for gene expression while  closed chromatin regions prevent the activity of transcriptional machinery.

Therefore,  there is a great demand in developing computational methods to identify chromatin accessibility from MAPit-BGS and NOMe-seq.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In our study of nearly 700 patients, we examined EZH2  expression and its association with tumor cell proliferation and other tumor  markers, clinical features, and prognosis in cutaneous melanoma and cancers of  the endometrium, prostate, and breast. RESULTS: Strong EZH2 expression was associated with increased tumor cell  proliferation in all four cancer types. Associations were also found between EZH2 and important clinicopathologic variables. EZH2 expression showed  significant prognostic impact in melanoma, prostate, and endometrial carcinoma  in univariate survival analyses, and revealed independent prognostic importance in carcinoma of the endometrium and prostate.

Is H4K20 methylation associated with DNA replication?,"No, there is no mention of H4K20 methylation being associated with DNA replication in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that constitutive heterochromatin is defined epigenetically by methylation of histone H3 at lys"," Context: We describe an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing  (ATAC-seq), based on direct in vitro transposition of sequencing adaptors into  native chromatin, as a rapid and sensitive method for integrative epigenomic  analysis. ATAC-seq captures open chromatin sites using a simple two-step  protocol with 500-50,000 cells and reveals the interplay between genomic  locations of open chromatin, DNA-binding proteins, individual nucleosomes and  chromatin compaction at nucleotide resolution. We discovered classes of  DNA-binding factors that strictly avoided, could tolerate or tended to overlap  with nucleosomes. Using ATAC-seq maps of human CD4(+) T cells from a proband obtained on consecutive days, we demonstrated the feasibility of analyzing an  individual's epigenome on a timescale compatible with clinical decision-making.  ,  Context: delete core CTCF binding sites in three loci, including the CTCF site in the  Sox2 super-enhancer. In all instances, CTCF and cohesin recruitment were lost,  and chromatin loops with distal, convergent CTCF sites were disrupted or  destabilized. Re-insertion of oppositely oriented CTCF recognition sequences  restored CTCF and cohesin recruitment, but did not re-establish chromatin loops.  We conclude that CTCF binding polarity plays a functional role in the formation  of higher-order chromatin structure.  ,  Context:  Constitutive heterochromatin is an important component of eukaryotic genomes  that has essential roles in nuclear architecture, DNA repair and genome  stability, and silencing of transposon and gene expression. Heterochromatin is highly enriched for repetitive sequences, and is defined epigenetically by  methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 and recruitment of its binding partner  heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). A prevalent view of heterochromatic silencing is that these and associated factors lead to chromatin compaction, resulting in  steric exclusion of regulatory proteins such as RNA polymerase from the  underlying DNA. However, compaction alone does not account for the formation of  ,  Context: The packaging of eukaryotic DNA into chromatin has profound consequences for  gene regulation, as well as for other DNA transactions such as recombination,  replication and repair. Understanding how this packaging is determined is  consequently a pressing problem in molecular genetics. DNA sequence, chromatin  remodelers and transcription factors affect chromatin structure, but the scope  of these influences on genome-wide nucleosome occupancy patterns remains uncertain. Here, we use high resolution tiling arrays to examine the  contributions of two general regulatory factors, Abf1 and Rap1, to nucleosome  occupancy in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These factors have each been shown to bind to a few hundred promoters, but we find here that thousands of loci show  localized regions of altered nucleosome occupancy within 1 h of loss of Abf1 or  Rap1 binding, and that altered chromatin structure can occur via binding sites  ,  Context:  The arrangement of nucleosomes in chromatin plays a role in transcriptional  regulation by restricting the accessibility of transcription factors and RNA  polymerase II to cis-acting elements and promoters. For gene activation, the chromatin structure is altered to an open configuration. The mechanism for this  process has been extensively analyzed. However, the mechanism by which  repressive chromatin is reconstituted to terminate transcription has not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which chromatin is  reconstituted in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombefbp1 gene, which is  robustly induced upon glucose starvation but tightly repressed under  ,  Context: Spt6 is a highly conserved factor required for normal transcription and  chromatin structure. To gain new insights into the roles of Spt6, we measured  nucleosome occupancy along Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome III in an spt6  mutant. We found that the level of nucleosomes is greatly reduced across some,  but not all, coding regions in an spt6 mutant, with nucleosome loss  preferentially occurring over highly transcribed genes. This result provides  strong support for recent studies that have suggested that transcription at low  levels does not displace nucleosomes, while transcription at high levels does,  and adds the idea that Spt6 is required for restoration of nucleosomes at the highly transcribed genes. Unexpectedly, our studies have also suggested that the  spt6 effects on nucleosome levels across coding regions do not cause the spt6  effects on mRNA levels, suggesting that the role of Spt6 across coding regions is separate from its role in transcriptional regulation. In the case of the CHA1  gene, regulation by Spt6 likely occurs by controlling the position of the +1  nucleosome. These results, along with previous studies, suggest that Spt6  ","24097267, 26527277, 28636597, 21081559, 29967244, 21098123","We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells.

The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.

These findings suggest  fundamental differences in the forces responsible for the evolution of RNA editing in nuclear versus mitochondrial systems.  ,  Context: The adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editomes have been systematically  characterized in various metazoan species, and many editing sites were found in  clusters. However, it remains unclear whether the clustered editing sites tend  to be linked in the same RNA molecules or not. By adopting a method originally  designed to detect linkage disequilibrium of DNA mutations, we examined the  editomes of ten metazoan species and detected extensive linkage of editing in  Drosophila and cephalopods. The prevalent linkages of editing in these two  clades, many of which are conserved between closely related species and might be  associated with the adaptive proteomic recoding, are maintained by natural selection at the cost of genome evolution. Nevertheless, in worms and humans, we  only detected modest proportions of linked editing events, the majority of which  were not conserved. Furthermore, the linkage of editing in coding regions of worms and humans might be overall deleterious, which drives the evolution of DNA  sites to escape promiscuous editing.

Their glucose-lowering effect results from improving insulin sensitivity in a  complementary fashion: metformin reduces hepatic glucose production and TZDs  increase skeletal muscle glucose use. The combination of metformin and  rosiglitazone in a single pill (Avandamet), was approved by the FDA in October  2002 for the treatment of diabetes. As insulin resistance is a pathophysiologic  cornerstone of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, the use of Avandamet represents an optimal approach to the treatment of diabetes. This manuscript  reviews the pharmacology, safety and benefits of the combination pill Avandamet.  ,  Context: acting by different cellular mechanisms. The two agents can be used in  combination to achieve additive glucose-lowering efficacy in the treatment of  type 2 diabetes, without stimulating insulin secretion and without causing  hypoglycaemia. Both agents also reduce a range of atherothrombotic factors and  markers, indicating a lower cardiovascular risk. Early intervention with  metformin is already known to reduce myocardial infarction and increase survival  in overweight type 2 patients. Recently, a single-tablet combination of  metformin and rosiglitazone, Avandamet, has become available. Avandamet is  suitable for type 2 diabetic patients who are inadequately controlled by monotherapy with metformin or rosiglitazone. Patients already receiving separate  tablets of metformin and rosiglitazone may switch to the single-tablet  combination for convenience. Also, early introduction of the combination before maximal titration of one agent can reduce side effects. Use of Avandamet  requires attention to the precautions for both metformin and rosiglitazone,  especially renal, cardiac and hepatic competence.

To correct the splice defect, we developed  a gene therapeutic approach using mutation-adapted U1 small nuclear RNA (U1). U1  is required for SDS recognition of pre-mRNAs and initiates the splice process.  The mutation described herein interferes with the recognition of the SDS by U1.  To overcome the deleterious effects of the mutation, we generated four U1  isoforms with increasing complementarity to the SDS. Lentiviral particles were  used to transduce patient-derived fibroblasts with these U1 variants. Full  complementarity of U1 corrects the splice defect partially and increases  recognition of the mutant SDS. The therapeutic effect is U1-concentration dependent as we show for endogenously expressed RPGR transcripts in  patient-derived cells. U1-based gene therapeutic approaches constitute promising  technologies to treat SDS mutations in inherited diseases including X-linked RP.  ,  Context: We describe a gene silencing method that employs a mechanism of action distinct  from those of antisense and RNA interference. U1 Adaptors are bifunctional  oligonucleotides with a 'target domain' complementary to a site in the target  gene's terminal exon and a 'U1 domain' that binds to the U1 small nuclear RNA  component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) splicing factor.  Tethering of U1 snRNP to the target pre-mRNA inhibits poly(A)-tail addition, causing degradation of that RNA species in the nucleus. U1 Adaptors can inhibit  both endogenous and reporter genes in a sequence-specific manner. Comparison of  U1 Adaptors with small interfering RNA (siRNA) using a genome-wide microarray analysis indicates that U1 Adaptors have limited off-target effects and no  detectable adverse effects on splicing. Further, targeting the same gene either  with multiple U1 Adaptors or with a U1 Adaptor and siRNA strongly enhances gene  silencing.  ,  Context: We describe a gene silencing method that employs a mechanism of action distinct  from those of antisense and RNA interference.

However, it is mentioned that gastrin releasing peptide (GRP, also called"," Context:  Lung cancer has increased in incidence throughout the twentieth century and is  now the most common cancer in the Western World. It has a poor prognosis, only  10-15% of patients survive 5 years or longer. Outcome is dependent on clinical stage and cancer cell type. Lung cancer is broadly subclassified on the basis of  histological features into squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, large cell  carcinoma and small cell carcinoma. The histopathological type of lung cancer correlates with tumour behaviour and prognosis. Staging based on prognosis is  essential in clinical trials comparing different management strategies, and  enables universal communication regarding the efficacy of different treatments  ,  Context:  Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide and the most common cause of  cancer-related death. Non-small-cell lung cancer comprises ~87% of newly  diagnosed cases of lung cancer, and nearly one-third of these patients have stage III disease. Despite improvements in the treatment of stage IV lung  cancer, particularly with the introduction and dissemination of checkpoint  inhibitors, very little progress has been made in the treatment of stage III lung cancer. In this article, we discuss the general staging criteria and  treatment options for stage III lung cancer. We review how concurrent radiation  and chemotherapy can have immunomodulatory effects, supporting the rationale for  ,  Context: cell lung cancer, expression without amplification or rearrangement of myc genes  is seen. In contrast, high level expression of p53 is not associated with gene  amplification in any lung cancer type. In addition, to these proto-oncogenes  acting at a presumed nuclear locus, there is increased expression of various ras  family members and the c-raf-1 proto-oncogene (in collaboration with Dr. Ulf  Rapp). Lung cancer cells in tissue culture can grow in medium without serum and  few or no other growth factors added. Thus, it appears that lung cancer cells  can produce their own growth factors which can act in an ""autocrine"" fashion.  The best characterized example of this is gastrin releasing peptide (GRP, also called bombesin) produced by small cell lung cancer. In at least some small cell  lung cancers, interference with GRP action by specific monoclonal antibodies  results in inhibition of tumor cell growth in culture and in nude mouse xenografts. Thus, constitutively expressed GRP gene may function as a cellular  oncogene under certain circumstances in small cell lung cancer. Based on these  observations we are proposing to test monoclonal anti-GRP antibodies in  patients.  ,  Context: mesothelioma. Nectin-4 is a new candidate for serum and tissue biomarker as well  as a therapeutic target for lung cancer. Clinical presentations have provided us  a great deal information on epidermal growth factor receptor mutations for  personalized therapy, combination therapy with inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase  activity of epidermal growth factor receptor and cytotoxic agents,  antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity, and current management of  lung cancer depending on both the extent of the disease and the treatment  approach.  ,  Context: expression, indicating positive regulation of P1 by the Sp1 protein. Notably Sp1  inhibition or knockdown also reduces DeltaNup73 protein levels. Therefore, Sp1  directly regulates TAp73 transcription and affects DeltaNup73 levels in lung  cancer. TAp73gamma was shown to be the only TA isoform overexpressed in several  lung cancer cell lines and in 26 non-small cell lung cancers, consistent with  Sp1 overexpression, thereby questioning the apoptotic role of this specific p73  isoform in lung cancer.  ,  Context: adenocarcinomas as compared to normal lung tissue. BHLHB3 gene overexpression  inhibited colony formation of A549, NCI-H520 and NCI-H596 lung cancer cells. The  reduced colony growth was likely due to inhibition of cell proliferation as  suggested by the downregulation of cyclin D1 (CCND1) expression in NCI-H520  cells transfected to overexpress the BHLHB3 gene; no evidence of apoptosis was  observed. These results point to the potential role of the BHLHB3 protein as a  tumor suppressor for lung cancer.

What is the aim of iodine prophylaxis?,There is no mention of iodine prophylaxis in the provided context.," Context: harm in certain subgroups. These trials have usually involved the administration  of single antioxidant nutrients given at relatively high doses. The results of  trials investigating the effect of a balanced combination of antioxidants at  levels achievable by diet are awaited. CONCLUSION: The suggestion that antioxidant supplements can prevent chronic  diseases has not been proved or consistently supported by the findings of  published intervention trials. Further evidence regarding the efficacy, safety  and appropriate dosage of antioxidants in relation to chronic disease is needed.  The most prudent public health advice remains to increase the consumption of plant foods, as such dietary patterns are associated with reduced risk of  chronic disease.  ,  Context: patient 2. Because many patients with WE present with vomiting at an early  stage, we should take care not to confuse WE with gastroenterocolitis. In  addition, it should be noted that some patients with WE present with seizure.  Because these 2 cases resulted from an unbalanced diet, it is important to  evaluate the patients' eating and drinking habits and advise their parents on  proper nutrition. Since many people believe that isotonic drinks are very  beneficial and consume them frequently, we should promote awareness that they  can be harmful when consumed in excess.  ,  Context: contributor to cardiovascular-protective effects. However, epidemiological  studies, which are necessary to evaluate an association between the risk of CVD  and cocoa polyphenol, remain sparse.  METHODS: We will discuss recent evidence regarding the association between cocoa  polyphenol consumption and the risks of CVD and its risk factors by reviewing  recent epidemiological studies. We shall also provide some guidance for patient  counseling and will discuss the public health implications for recommending  cocoa polyphenol consumption to prevent CVD. RESULTS: Epidemiological studies evaluating the association between cocoa polyphenol itself and the risk of CVD are sparse. However, evidence from limited  epidemiological studies suggests that cocoa polyphenol consumption may lower the  risk of CVD. CONCLUSION: Given the potential adverse effects of the consumption of cocoa products with high fat and sugar and the fact that the most appropriate dose of  cocoa polyphenol for cardio-protective effects has not yet been established,  health care providers should remain cautious about recommending cocoa/cocoa  ,  Context: levels achievable by diet are awaited.

RESULTS: In all studies diet had an effect on cardiovascular disease risk. The  Mediterranean diet, a high-quality diet and increased fruit and vegetable  consumption were all found to be cardioprotective. CONCLUSION: The systematically reviewed studies reveal that a high adherence to  a Mediterranean type of diet or ""prudent diet"" is associated with reduced risk  of CVD and some types of cancer, even in the elderly.

Monoallelic (heterozygous) BRCA2 mutations confer a high risk of breast  cancer and are a major cause of familial breast cancer. To investigate whether heterozygous variants in other FA genes are high penetrance breast cancer  susceptibility alleles, we screened germ-line DNA from 88 BRCA1/2-negative  families, each with at least three cases of breast cancer, for mutations in FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, and FANCG.

None of the exonic variants resulted in  translational frameshifts or nonsense codons and 14 were polymorphisms  ,  Context: sequencing. Thirteen of these families were clinically diagnosed with WS and one  family with isolated non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL). Intra-familial  phenotypic variability and non-penetrance were observed in families diagnosed  with WS1, WS2 and WS4 with pathogenic variants in PAX3, MITF and EDNRB,  respectively. We observed gonosomal mosaicism for a variant in PAX3 in an  asymptomatic father of two affected siblings. For the first time, we report a  biallelic pathogenic variant in MITF in a subject with WS2 and a biallelic  variant in EDNRB was noted in a subject with WS2. An individual with isolated  NSHL carried a pathogenic variant in MITF. Blended phenotype of NSHL and albinism was observed in a subject clinically diagnosed to have WS2. A phenocopy  of WS1 was observed in a subject with a reported pathogenic variant in GJB2,  known to cause isolated NSHL. These novel and infrequently reported observations exemplify the allelic and genetic heterogeneity and show phenotypic diversity of  WS.  ,  Context: patients exhibited CD characterized by abnormal ciliary motion and nNO levels  below or near the PCD cutoff values. Patients with CD aged >6 years show  increased respiratory symptoms similar to those seen in PCD. Sequencing of all  14 known PCD genes in 13 heterotaxy patients with CD, 12 without CD, 10 PCD  disease controls, and 13 healthy controls yielded 0.769, 0.417, 1.0, and 0.077  novel variants per patient, respectively. One heterotaxy patient with CD had the  PCD causing DNAI1 founder mutation. Another with hyperkinetic ciliary beat had 2  mutations in DNAH11, the only PCD gene known to cause hyperkinetic beat. Among  PCD patients, 2 had known PCD causing CCDC39 and CCDC40 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies show that CHD patients with heterotaxy have substantial  risk for CD and increased respiratory disease. Heterotaxy patients with CD were  enriched for mutations in PCD genes. Future studies are needed to assess the potential benefit of prescreening and prophylactically treating heterotaxy  patients for CD.  ,  Context: centres, is challenging because recent studies have expanded the spectrum of  HVMA findings in PCD from grossly abnormal to very subtle. The objective of this  study was to describe the diversity of HVMA findings in genetically confirmed  PCD individuals. HVMA was performed as part of the routine work-up of  individuals with suspected PCD. Subsequent molecular analysis identified  biallelic mutations in the PCD-related genes of 66 individuals. 1072 videos of  these subjects were assessed for correlation with the genotype. Biallelic  mutations (19 novel) were found in 17 genes: DNAI1, DNAI2, DNAH5, DNAH11,  CCDC103, ARMC4, KTU/DNAAF2, LRRC50/DNAAF1, LRRC6, DYX1C1, ZMYND10, CCDC39, CCDC40, CCDC164, HYDIN, RSPH4A and RSPH1. Ciliary beat pattern variations  correlated well with the genetic findings, allowing the classification of  typical HVMA findings for different genetic groups. In contrast, analysis of ciliary beat frequency did not result in additional diagnostic impact. In  conclusion, this study provides detailed knowledge about the diversity of HVMA  findings in PCD and may therefore be seen as a guide to the improvement of PCD  diagnostics.  ,  Context: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder leading to recurrent  respiratory tract infections.

Although TORC1 signaling is  repressed by various stresses in yeast, the underlying mechanisms remain  elusive. Here we report that TORC1 signaling upon heat stress is regulated by  stress granules (SGs), which are cytoplasmic foci formed under certain stresses.  Ectopic formation of SGs achieved by Pbp1 overexpression in unstressed cells sequesters TORC1 in this compartment, thereby blunting TORC1 signaling. Upon  heat stress, a physiological SG-inducing condition, TORC1 is also recruited to  SGs, which delays reactivation of TORC1 signaling during recovery from heat stress. Moreover, TORC1 reactivation is directed through SG disassembly,  suggesting that SGs act as a key determinant for TORC1 reactivation during  recovery from heat stress. Furthermore, this mechanism contributes to reduction  ,  Context:  Stress granule (SG) assembly represents a conserved eukaryotic defense strategy  against various insults. Although essential for the ability to cope with  deleterious conditions, the signaling pathways controlling SG formation are not fully understood. The energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is  critical for the cellular stress response. Human cells produce two AMPK  catalytic α-subunits with not only partially overlapping, but also unique functions. Here, we provide direct support for structural and functional links  between AMPK-α isoforms and SGs. As such, several stressors promote SG  association of AMPK-α2, but not AMPK-α1.

Importantly, ALS related mutations modulate the propensity of TDP-43  to aggregate in cell culture. Several recent studies have documented that  cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates co-localize with stress granule markers. Stress  granules are cytoplasmic inclusions that repress translation of a subset of RNAs  in times of cellular stress, and several proteins implicated in  neurodegeneration (i.e. Ataxin-2 and SMN) interact with stress granules. Thus,  understanding the interplay between TDP-43 aggregation, stress granules and the effect of ALS-associated TDP-43 mutations may be the key to understanding the  role of TDP-43 in neurodegeneration. We propose two models of TDP-43 aggregate  formation. The ""independent model"" stipulates that TDP-43 aggregation is independent of stress granule formation, in contrast to the ""precursor model""  which presents the idea that stress granule formation contributes to a TDP-43  aggregate ""seed"" and that chronic stress leads to concentration-dependent TDP-43  ","18775331, 18775331, 22727621, 25840010, 25840010, 22405725",5'-AMP-activated protein kinase alpha regulates stress granule biogenesis,25840010,0.861,[0.618 0.618 0.595 0.701 0.701 0.396],[0.638 0.638 0.617 0.884 0.884 0.435],0.792

The goal of this study was to investigate macrophage-related  inflammation in osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: Twenty-five individuals (50 knees) with symptomatic OA of at least one  knee underwent SPECT-CT imaging of both knees and planar imaging of the whole  body after injection of Etarfolatide. Scans and knee radiographs were scored  blinded to clinical information including knee and other joint site pain  severity. Measures of association controlled for age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and employed repeated measures to adjust for correlation between knees. DESIGN: Activated macrophages were present in the majority (76%) of knees. The  quantity of knee-related macrophages was significantly associated with knee pain severity (R = 0.60, P < 0.0001) and radiographic knee OA severity including  joint space narrowing (R = 0.68, P = 0.007), and osteophyte (R = 0.66,  P = 0.001).

METHODS: In a multicenter, open-label study, we evaluated the effect of  intraventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa every 2 weeks in children with CLN2 disease who were between the ages of 3 and 16 years. Treatment was  initiated at a dose of 30 mg, 100 mg, or 300 mg; all the patients then received  the 300-mg dose for at least 96 weeks. The primary outcome was the time until a  ,  Context: was not reached for treated patients and was 345 days for historical controls.  The mean (±SD) unadjusted rate of decline in the motor-language score per  48-week period was 0.27±0.35 points in treated patients and 2.12±0.98 points in  42 historical controls (mean difference, 1.85; P<0.001). Common adverse events  included convulsions, pyrexia, vomiting, hypersensitivity reactions, and failure  of the intraventricular device. In 2 patients, infections developed in the  intraventricular device that was used to administer the infusion, which required  antibiotic treatment and device replacement. CONCLUSIONS: Intraventricular infusion of cerliponase alfa in patients with CLN2 disease resulted in less decline in motor and language function than that in  historical controls. Serious adverse events included failure of the  intraventricular device and device-related infections.

For the constructions of which organs has 3D printing been tested?,Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting has been tested for the construction of human skin as a prototypical example.," Context: We recently developed a cell printer (Wilson and Boland, 2003) that enables us  to place cells in positions that mimic their respective positions in organs.  However, this technology was limited to the printing of two-dimensional (2D)  tissue constructs. Here we describe the use of thermosensitive gels to generate  sequential layers for cell printing. The ability to drop cells on previously  printed successive layers provides a real opportunity for the realization of  three-dimensional (3D) organ printing. Organ printing will allow us to print  complex 3D organs with computer-controlled, exact placing of different cell  types, by a process that can be completed in several minutes. To demonstrate the feasibility of this novel technology, we showed that cell aggregates can be  placed in the sequential layers of 3D gels close enough for fusion to occur. We  estimated the optimum minimal thickness of the gel that can be reproducibly generated by dropping the liquid at room temperature onto a heated substrate.

Here, we examine the role of the related transcription  factors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. Overexpression  of either ECM22 or UPC2 leads to increased filamentation, whereas cells lacking  both ECM22 and UPC2 do not exhibit filamentous growth.

What is BBCAnalyzer?,BBCAnalyzer (Bases By CIGAR Analyzer) is a tool that provides a novel visual approach to facilitate manual inspection of common mutation sites by visualizing base counts at predefined positions or regions in sequence alignment data available as BAM files.," Context: BACKGROUND: Deriving valid variant calling results from raw next-generation  sequencing data is a particularly challenging task, especially with respect to  clinical diagnostics and personalized medicine. However, when using classic  variant calling software, the user usually obtains nothing more than a list of  variants that pass the corresponding caller's internal filters.

Describe OligoSTORM,"OligoSTORM is a type of brainstem oligodendroglial tumor that can include histone H3.3-mutated tumors and has a tendency to disseminate throughout the neuroaxis at the time of relapse, as"," Context: middle cerebellar peduncle, and part of the left cerebellar hemisphere on  T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, with an enhanced  spot lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere. The pathological diagnosis was  anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and we identified a mutation in histone H3.3 in  the tumor specimen. He succumbed to massive disseminated relapse 7 months from  diagnosis despite local radiation therapy. The second patient, a 2-year-old  girl, was diagnosed with oligoastrocytoma. Brain MRI revealed a large mass in  her rostral pons extended to the fourth ventricle with obstructive  hydrocephalus. The tumor recurred with intracranial dissemination 56 months  post-surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric brainstem oligodendroglial tumors can include histone  H3.3-mutated tumors and have a tendency to disseminate throughout the neuroaxis  at the time of relapse.  ,  Context: homolog is a conserved member of certain histone methyltransferase (HMT)  complexes. In the human MLL1 (mixed-lineage leukemia-1) HMT complex, DPY-30L  binds to the BRE2 homolog ASH2L in order to regulate histone 3-lysine 4  trimethylation. We have determined the 1.2-A crystal structure of the human  DPY-30L C-terminal domain (DPY-30L(C)). The DPY-30L(C) structure, harboring the  conserved DPY-30 motif, is composed of two alpha-helices linked by a sharp loop  and forms a typical X-type four-helix bundle required for dimer formation.  DPY-30L(C) dimer formation is largely mediated by an extensive hydrophobic  interface with some additional polar interactions. The oligomerization of DPY-30L(C) in solution, together with its reported binding to ASH2L, leads us to  propose that the hydrophobic surface of the dimer may provide a platform for  interaction with ASH2L in the MLL1 HMT complex.  ,  Context:  Electrical storm is a challenging diagnosis for the clinician and requires  detailed evaluation of the patient. Amiodarone is frequently used for the  cessation of ventricular tachycardia attacks. Within antiarrhythmic effects of amiodarone, there are some harmful effects of the recent drug. Thyroid gland  toxicity is one of the most important adverse effects of amiodarone and is  called amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. Thyrotoxicosis may alter arrhythmia and lead to frequent ventricular tachycardia attacks. Herein, we report a case  of electrical storm caused by amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis.  ,  Context: Purpose: Platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα) is implicated in  several adult and pediatric malignancies, where activated signaling in tumor  cells and/or cells within the microenvironment drive tumorigenesis and disease  progression.

The automated analyses of individual lipid molecular  species in the program employ a strategy in which MDMS-SL data from building  block analyses using precursor ion scans, neutral loss scans, or both are used  to identify individual molecular species, followed by quantitation. Through this  strategy, the program screens and identifies species in a high-throughput  fashion from a built-in database of over 36,000 potential lipid molecular  species constructed employing known building blocks. The program then uses a  two-step procedure for quantitation of the identified species possessing a linear dynamic range over 3 orders of magnitude and reverifies the results when  necessary through redundant quantification of multidimensional mass spectra.  This program is designed to be easily adaptable for other shotgun lipidomics approaches that are currently used for mass spectrometric analysis of lipids.  Accordingly, the development of this program should greatly accelerate  high-throughput analysis of lipids using MDMS-based shotgun lipidomics.

Which one of the CYP450 enzymes is the second most frequently implicated in the metabolism of the drugs currently available on the market?,CYP2D6 is the second most frequently implicated in the metabolism of the drugs currently available on the market.," Context: One of the major reasons for late-stage failure of drug candidates is due to  problems uncovered in pharmacokinetics during clinical trials. There is now a  general consensus for earlier consideration of these effects in the drug  discovery process. Computer-aided design technology provides us with tools to  develop predictive models for such pharmacokinetic properties. Among these  tools, we focus on pharmacophore modeling techniques in this article.  Pharmacophore models that are reported for various cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes  are reviewed for the isoenzymes CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4. In  addition pharmacophore models for related metabolic processes through CYP19 (aromatase), CYP51 (14.α-lanosterol demethylase), PXR (pregnane X-receptor), and  finally for human intrinsic clearance are also reviewed. The models reported by  various scientists are schematically represented in the figures in order to visually demonstrate their similarities and differences. The models developed by  different researchers or sometimes even by the same research group for different  sets of ligands, provide a clear picture of the challenges in coming up with a  ,  Context: sacubitril/valsartan, aspirin, or sildenafil. RESULTS: In the human mass balance study, mean total radioactivity recovered was  98.3% of the dose administered (53.1% and 45.2% excreted via urine and feces,  respectively). The main metabolic pathway of vericiguat is glucuronidation via  uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A9 and 1A1. In vitro studies  revealed a low risk of vericiguat acting as a perpetrator by inhibiting  cytochrome P450s, uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms, or major  transport proteins, or by inducing cytochrome P450s. These observations were  supported by phase I drug-drug interaction studies. Phase I studies that assessed the propensity of vericiguat as a victim drug showed changes in the  range that did not warrant recommendations for dose adjustment in phase III. CONCLUSIONS: A low pharmacokinetic interaction potential of vericiguat was estimated from in vitro data and confirmed in vivo. Thus, vericiguat is suitable  for a patient population with multiple comorbidities requiring polypharmacy.  ,  Context: Drug interactions involving protease inhibitors are common. Protease inhibitors  are well known inhibitors of the 3A4 isozyme of cytochrome P450. Select protease  inhibitors, including co-formulated lopinavir/ritonavir, may induce  glucuronidation or the activity of other CYP450 isozymes. We describe the case  of a patient taking warfarin who experienced a significantly decreased  international normalized ratio after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy that included lopinavir/ritonavir. We review the possible mechanisms of this  interaction and the reported interactions between warfarin and other protease  inhibitors.  ,  Context: The formation of reactive metabolites through biotransformation is the suspected  cause of many adverse drug reactions. Testing for the propensity of a drug to  form reactive metabolites has increasingly become an integral part of  lead-optimization strategy in drug discovery. DNA reactivity is one undesirable  facet of a drug or its metabolites and can lead to increased risk of cancer and  reproductive toxicity. Many drugs are metabolized by cytochromes P450 in the liver and other tissues, and these reactions can generate hard electrophiles.  These hard electrophilic reactive metabolites may react with DNA and may be  detected in standard in vitro genotoxicity assays; however, the majority of these assays fall short due to the use of animal-derived organ extracts that  inadequately represent human metabolism. The current study describes the  development of bacterial systems that efficiently detect DNA-damaging  ,  Context:  Drug interactions involving protease inhibitors are common. Protease inhibitors  are well known inhibitors of the 3A4 isozyme of cytochrome P450. Select protease  inhibitors, including co-formulated lopinavir/ritonavir, may induce glucuronidation or the activity of other CYP450 isozymes. We describe the case  of a patient taking warfarin who experienced a significantly decreased  international normalized ratio after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy that included lopinavir/ritonavir. We review the possible mechanisms of this  interaction and the reported interactions between warfarin and other protease  inhibitors.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Atemoya (Annona atemoya) is increasingly being  consumed worldwide because of its pleasant taste. However, only limited  information is available concerning possible atemoya-drug interactions. In the  present study, the issue of whether atemoya shows food-drug interactions with  substrate drugs of the major drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450s (i.e., CYP1A2,  CYP2C9, and CYP3A) is addressed. METHODS: The ability of atemoya juice to inhibit the activities of phenacetin  O-deethylase (CYP1A2), diclofenac 4'-hydroxylase (CYP2C9), and midazolam  1'-hydroxylase (CYP3A) was examined in vitro using human and rat liver microsomes. The in vivo pharmacokinetics of phenacetin and metabolites derived  from it in rats when atemoya juice or fluvoxamine (a CYP1A2 inhibitor) was  preadministered were also investigated.

The  RNA-binding protein HuR modulates the stability and translation of many target  mRNAs. Here, we investigated the role of HuR in the regulation of occludin  expression and therefore in the intestinal epithelial barrier function. HuR bound the 3'-untranslated region of the occludin mRNA and enhanced occludin  translation. HuR association with the occludin mRNA depended on Chk2-dependent  HuR phosphorylation. Reduced HuR phosphorylation by Chk2 silencing or by reduction of Chk2 through polyamine depletion decreased HuR-binding to the  occludin mRNA and repressed occludin translation, whereas Chk2 overexpression  enhanced (HuR/occludin mRNA) association and stimulated occludin expression.

HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Through its post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation, senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli.","17392515, 15861128, 23508105, 22201738, 19345675, 23223443, 21816340, 22310293, 21745814, 19289500, 17288991, 23401122, 21164076, 23837869, 19252527, 9763509, 23155001, 14530362, 15543229, 11486028, 15863502, 10673359, 9628881, 16639702, 9155038, 10075998, 9860962, 20007147, 19884656, 15036402, 15824116, 21515253, 12605686, 24152440, 17317627, 22446588, 12242302, 12730239",0.661,[0.547 0.547 0.598 0.598 0.598 0.501],[0.585 0.585 0.588 0.588 0.588 0.462],0.649
What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?,"DNA thermodynamic stability is a major component determinant of the genetic organization of an organism, specifically in budding yeast."," Context:  MOTIVATION: The intrinsic DNA sequence is an important determinant of nucleosome  positioning. Some DNA sequence patterns can facilitate nucleosome formation,  while others can inhibit nucleosome formation. Nucleosome positioning influences the overall rate of sequence evolution. However, its impacts on specific  patterns of sequence evolution are still poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, we examined whether nucleosomal DNA and nucleosome-depleted DNA show distinct polymorphism patterns to maintain adequate nucleosome architecture  on a genome scale in yeast. We found that sequence polymorphisms in nucleosomal  DNA tend to facilitate nucleosome formation, whereas polymorphisms in  ,  Context: A major question in chromatin biology is to what extent the sequence of DNA  directly determines the genetic and chromatin organization of a eukaryotic  genome? We consider two aspects to this question: the DNA sequence-specified  positioning of nucleosomes and the determination of NDRs (nucleosome-depleted  regions) or barriers. We argue that, in budding yeast, while DNA  sequence-specified nucleosome positioning may contribute to positions flanking the regions lacking nucleosomes, DNA thermodynamic stability is a major  component determinant of the genetic organization of this organism.  ,  Context:  Recent studies of genome-wide nucleosomal organization suggest that the DNA  sequence is one of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning. Although  the search for underlying patterns encoded in nucleosomal DNA has been going on for about 30 years, our knowledge of these patterns still remains limited. Based  on our evaluations of DNA deformation energy, we developed new scoring functions  to predict nucleosome positioning. There are three principal differences between our approach and earlier studies: (i) we assume that the length of nucleosomal  DNA varies from 146 to 147 bp; (ii) we consider the anisotropic flexibility of  pyrimidine-purine (YR) dimeric steps in the context of their neighbors (e.g.,  ,  Context: minor-groove bending sites SHL+/- 3.5 and +/- 5.5, which is similar to the  alpha-satellite sequence used in most crystallized nucleosomes. Apparently, the  positioning of these nucleosomes is determined by the interactions between  histones H2A/H2B and the terminal parts of nucleosomal DNA. In the other group  (that includes the '601' clone) the same YR/YYRR motifs occur predominantly at  the sites SHL +/- 1.5. The interaction between the H3/H4 tetramer and the  central part of the nucleosomal DNA is likely to be responsible for the  positioning of nucleosomes of this group, and the DNA trajectory in these  nucleosomes may differ in detail from the published structures. Thus, from the stereochemical perspective, the in vitro nucleosomes studied here follow either  an X-ray-like pattern (with strong deformations in the terminal parts of  nucleosomal DNA), or an alternative pattern (with the deformations occurring predominantly in the central part of the nucleosomal DNA). The results presented  here may be useful for genome-wide classification of nucleosomes, linking  together structural and thermodynamic characteristics of nucleosomes with the  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: The organization of eukaryotic DNA into chromatin has a strong  influence on the accessibility and regulation of genetic information. The  locations and occupancies of a principle component of chromatin, nucleosomes, are typically assayed through use of enzymatic digestion with micrococcal  nuclease (MNase). MNase is an endo-exo nuclease that preferentially digests  naked DNA and the DNA in linkers between nucleosomes, thus enriching for nucleosome-associated DNA. To determine nucleosome organization genome-wide, DNA  remaining from MNase digestion is sequenced using high-throughput sequencing  technologies (MNase-seq). Unfortunately, the results of MNase-seq can vary  ,  Context: regularly positioned nucleosomes and may involve chromatin remodeling as a key  step of kinetochore assembly. We used tiling microarrays to show that  nucleosomes are, in fact, positioned in regular intervals in the core of  centromere 2, providing the first high-resolution map of regional centromere  chromatin. Nucleosome locations are not disrupted by mutations in kinetochore  protein genes cnp1, mis18, mis12, nuf2, mal2; overexpression of cnp1; or the  deletion of ams2, which encodes a GATA-like factor participating in CENPA  incorporation. Bioinformatics analysis of the centromere sequence indicates  certain enriched motifs in linker regions between nucleosomes and reveals a sequence bias in nucleosome positioning. In addition, sequence analysis of  nucleosome-free regions identifies novel binding sites of Ams2p. We conclude  that centromeric nucleosome positions are stable and may be derived from the underlying DNA sequence.

There is growing evidence that  bacterial genomes are organized into insulated domains similar to the  Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) detected in eukaryotic cells.  Chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies are used to analyze in vivo  DNA proximity based on ligation of distal DNA segments crossed-linked by bridging proteins. By combining 3C and high-throughput sequencing, the Hi-C  method reveals genome-wide interactions within topological domains and global  genome structure as a whole. This chapter provides detailed guidelines for the preparation of Hi-C sequencing libraries for bacteria.  ,  Context:  Recent research using chromatin conformation capture technologies, such as Hi-C,  has demonstrated the importance of topologically associated domains (TADs) and  smaller chromatin loops, collectively referred hereafter as ""interacting domains."" Many such domains change during development or disease, and exhibit  cell- and condition-specific differences. Quantification of the dynamic behavior  of interacting domains will help to better understand genome regulation. Methods for comparing interacting domains between cells and conditions are highly  limited. We developed TADCompare, a method for differential analysis of  boundaries of interacting domains between two or more Hi-C datasets.

We found evidence suggestive  ,  Context:  INTRODUCTION: The Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) gene, encoded on human chromosome  Xp22.3, is crucial for type I interferon production. A recent multicenter study  in East Asian populations, comprising Chinese, Korean and Japanese participants, identified an association of a TLR7 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located  in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR), rs3853839, with systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE), especially in males, although some difference was observed among the tested populations. To test whether additional polymorphisms  contribute to SLE in Japanese, we systematically analyzed the association of  TLR7 with SLE in a Japanese female population.  ,  Context: Medical Genetic Research Center of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences.  Forty CLCN1 gene mutations have been found in a total of 118 chromosomes of 66  probands, including 21 familial and 45 sporadic cases. About half the mutations  detected (45%) have been found for the first time; they are not described in the  SNP database (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The following mutations (substitutions) have  been detected in more than one chromosome, accounting for a total of 59.3% of  chromosomes with mutations: Glyl90Ser (5.9%), c.1437-1450del14 (9.3%), Ala493Glu  (5.1%), Thr550Met (3.4%), Tyr686Stop (5.1%), and Arg894Stop (30.5%).  ,  Context: Susceptibility to autoimmune disorders results from the interaction of multiple  genetic factors that regulate the threshold of autoreactivity. Genome-wide  microsatellite screens and large-scale single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)  association studies have identified chromosomal loci that are associated with  specific disorders including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis,  juvenile arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and diabetes. Numerous candidate gene  association studies have in turn investigated the association of specific genes  within these chromosomal regions, with susceptibility to autoimmune diseases  (e.g. FcgammaReceptors, TYK2 and systemic lupus). More recently, large-scale differential gene expression studies performed on selected tissues from patients  with autoimmune disorders, have led to the identification of gene signatures  associated with the activation of specific pathways in these diseases (e.g. interferon signature in lupus). In the future, integrated analyses of gene (and  protein) expression together with SNP data will allow us to sketch an  intelligible picture of the genesis of autoimmunity in humans. This review sets  ,  Context: The accelerated development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in male BXSB  mice is associated with the genetic abnormality in its Y chromosome, designated  Yaa (Y-linked autoimmune acceleration). Recently, the Yaa mutation was  identified to be a translocation from the telomeric end of the X chromosome  (containing the gene encoding TLR7) onto the Y chromosome. In the present study,  we determined whether the Tlr7 gene duplication is indeed responsible for the Yaa-mediated acceleration of SLE. Analysis of C57BL/6 mice congenic for the Nba2  (NZB autoimmunity 2) locus (B6.Nba2) bearing the Yaa mutation revealed that  introduction of the Tlr7 null mutation on the X chromosome significantly reduced serum levels of IgG autoantibodies against DNA and ribonucleoproteins, as well  as the incidence of lupus nephritis. However, the protection was not complete,  because these mice still developed high titers of anti-chromatin autoantibodies  ","19340878, 19340878, 21396113, 23113340, 18781962, 18606711",The TLR7 locus acts in vivo as a tumor suppressor gene and is located on chromosome X (X chromosome).,"27347137, 16777955, 18521959, 25339659, 21396113, 25541140, 16709748, 25650422, 18606711, 18682521, 30276444, 29374079",0.81,[0.342 0.35  0.458 0.517 0.349 0.475],[0.304 0.31  0.616 0.461 0.422 0.553],0.787

Increased Src activity has been shown to correlate with disease progression and  poor prognosis, suggesting Src could serve as a therapeutic target for kinase  inhibition. Saracatinib (AZD0530) is a novel selective oral Src kinase  inhibitor. METHODS: Metastatic colorectal cancer patients who had received one prior  treatment and had measurable disease were enrolled in this phase 2 study. Saracatinib was administered at 175 mg by mouth daily for 28 day cycles until  dose-limiting toxicity or progression as determined by staging every 2 cycles.  The primary endpoint was improvement in 4 month progression-free survival. Design of Thall, Simon, and Estey was used to monitor proportion of patients  that were progression free at 4 months.

Cell proliferation was tested by  [H3] DNA incorporation assay. Cell apoptosis was tested by caspase-3/-9 activity  assay, Histone DNA ELISA assay, Annexin V FACS assay and TUNEL staining assay.  Cell cycle progression was tested by propidium iodide (PI) FACS assay. Signaling  was tested by Western blotting assay. The nude mice PC-3 xenograft model was  applied to test AZD5153's activity in vivo. RESULTS: AZD5153 inhibited proliferation and survival of established and primary  prostate cancer cells. AZD5153 induced apoptosis activation and cell cycle arrest in prostate cancer cells. AZD5153 was non-cytotoxic to the prostate  epithelial cells.

What is the mechanism of action of abiraterone?,"Abiraterone acts as an antagonist to the androgen receptor, inhibits 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and inhibits the 17α-hydroxylase activity of CYP17, CYP11"," Context: Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease where the previous concept of  ""hormone resistance"" has been changed by a new generation of hormonal therapies  that have proven efficacy in the castration-resistant setting. The fact is that  androgens play a crucial role in the whole clinical course of prostate cancer,  even when a patient meets castration-resistance criteria. The development of  abiraterone showed how important and clinically meaningful can be to achieve the lowest possible levels of testosterone, and androgen receptor overexpression,  mutation, or enhanced crosstalk with other pathways, which can also be targeted  with new agents tested in the last few years. New androgen biosynthesis inhibitors have been developed, such as orteronel (TAK-700), but also new  antiandrogens (enzalutamide, ARN-509, ODM-201) or even agents with a dual  mechanism of action (galeterone). In this review the development of new hormonal  ,  Context: lowest possible levels of testosterone, and androgen receptor overexpression,  mutation, or enhanced crosstalk with other pathways, which can also be targeted  with new agents tested in the last few years. New androgen biosynthesis  inhibitors have been developed, such as orteronel (TAK-700), but also new  antiandrogens (enzalutamide, ARN-509, ODM-201) or even agents with a dual  mechanism of action (galeterone). In this review the development of new hormonal  therapies following the arrival of abiraterone for the treatment of prostate  cancer will be summarized.  ,  Context: The next-generation antiandrogen drugs, XTANDI (enzalutamide), ZYTIGA  (abiraterone acetate), ERLEADA (apalutamide) and NUBEQA (darolutamide) extend  survival times and improve quality of life in patients with advanced prostate  cancer. Despite these advances, resistance occurs frequently and there is  currently no definitive cure for castration-resistant prostate cancer. Our  previous studies identified that similar mechanisms of resistance to  enzalutamide or abiraterone occur following treatment and cross-resistance  exists between these therapies in advanced prostate cancer. Here, we show that  enzalutamide- and abiraterone-resistant prostate cancer cells are further cross-resistant to apalutamide and darolutamide. Mechanistically, we have  determined that the AKR1C3/AR-V7 axis confers this cross-resistance. Knockdown  of AR-V7 in enzalutamide-resistant cells resensitize cells to apalutamide and darolutamide treatment. Furthermore, targeting AKR1C3 resensitizes resistant  cells to apalutamide and darolutamide treatment through AR-V7 inhibition.

The latest approvals include abiraterone  acetate, enzalutamide and apalutamide which target androgen receptor (AR) signaling, radium-223 dichloride for reduction of bone metastases, sipuleucel-T  immunotherapy and taxane-based chemotherapy. Adding abiraterone acetate to  androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in order to achieve complete androgen blockade has proven highly beneficial for treatment of locally advanced prostate  cancer and metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). Also, ADT  together with docetaxel treatment showed significant benefit in mHSPC. Ongoing  ,  Context: cancer (CRPC)--in those who are chemotherapy-naive and those previously treated  with docetaxel. Furthermore, the clinical success of abiraterone demonstrated  that CRPC, which has previously been regarded as an androgen-independent  disease, is still driven, at least in part, by androgens. More importantly,  abiraterone is a 'promiscuous' drug that interacts with a number of targets,  which dictate its clinical benefits and adverse effects profile. Besides CYP17  inhibition, abiraterone acts as an antagonist to the androgen receptor and  inhibits 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase--two effects that potentially  contribute to its antitumour effects. However, the inhibition of the 17α-hydroxylase activity of CYP17, CYP11B1 and a panel of hepatic CYP enzymes  leads to adverse effects and toxicities that include secondary mineralocorticoid  excess. Abiraterone is also associated with increased incidence of cardiac disorders. Under such circumstances, development of new CYP17 inhibitors as an  additional line of defence is urgently needed.

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,"Thyroid hormone stimulates hepatic glucose production via a sympathetic pathway, but there is no explicit mention of thyronamines' effects on fat tissue. However, it is mentioned that further elucidation of central effects of thyroid hormone on autonomic outflow"," Context: release by rat liver mitochondria. Hypothyroid animals were used because of the  low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to  reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The  observed changes could be explained by a partial block, operated by  thyronamines, at a site located near the site of action of antimycin A. This  hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that thyronamines reduced the  activity of Complex III where the site of antimycin action is located. Because  thyronamines exerted their effects at concentrations comparable to those found  in hepatic tissue, it is conceivable that they can affect in vivo mitochondrial O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2) production acting as modulators of thyroid hormone  action.  ,  Context: release by rat liver mitochondria.

Recent experiments show that the  effects of thyrotoxicosis on hepatic glucose production and insulin sensitivity  can be modulated by selective hepatic sympathetic and parasympathetic  denervation. Indeed, thyroid hormone stimulates hepatic glucose production via a  sympathetic pathway, a novel central pathway for thyroid hormone action. Rodent  studies suggest that similar neural routes exist for thyroid hormone analogues  (e.g. thyronamines). Further elucidation of central effects of thyroid hormone  on autonomic outflow to metabolic organs, including the thyroid and brown  adipose tissue, will add to our understanding of hyperthyroidism.  ,  Context:  A class of thyroid hormone metabolites has dramatic physiological effects on  metabolism and heart rate by still-unknown mechanisms of action. A recent study  has discovered that thyronamines can inhibit neuronal reuptake of neurotransmitters and prevent the intracellular transport of monoamines for  release. This discovery presents a third signaling pathway for thyroid hormone,  expands the role that thyroid plays in the central nervous system, and suggests mechanisms of action for the effects of thyronamine-derived neuromodulators.  ,  Context: Sulfotransferases (SULTs) catalyze the sulfation of many endogenous compounds  that include monoamine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine (DA), and thyroid  hormones (iodothyronines). Decarboxylation of iodothyronines results in  formation of thyronamines. In the mouse, thyronamines act rapidly in a  nongenomic fashion to initiate hypothermia and decrease cardiac output and heart  rate. These effects are attenuated after 1-4 h, and metabolism of thyronamines via sulfation may be a mechanism for termination of thyronamine action. We  carried out this study to test thyronamine (T0AM), 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM),  3,5-diiodothyronamine (T2AM), and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronamine (T3AM) as substrates for human liver and cDNA-expressed SULT activities.

Which event results in the acetylation of S6K1?,Growth factor stimulation results in the acetylation of S6K1 at lysine 516.," Context: stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines. In addition to  phosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine  acetylation.

OBJECTIVE: To compare serum selenium (s-Se) values in patients with newly diagnosed autoimmune thyroid disease and controls from the Danish population. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: S-Se was measured in triplicate by a fluorimetric method. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with newly diagnosed Graves' disease (GD) (n = 97) or autoimmune overt hypothyroidism (AIH) (n = 96), euthyroid subjects with high  serum levels of thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) (TPO-Ab > 1500 U/ml,  n = 92) and random controls (n = 830). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Differences in s-Se values.  ,  Context: In areas with severe selenium deficiency there is a higher incidence of  thyroiditis due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione  peroxidase activity within thyroid cells.

Is calcium overload involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy?,"Yes, intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy."," Context: sympathetic nervous system and abnormalities in catecholamine metabolism have  been identified in diabetes; their involvement in the genesis of cardiac pump  failure as well as large and small vessel disease is likely. The membrane  defects as indicated by changes in both plasma membrane and glycocalyx in  diabetic cardiomyopathy appear to be complex and may involve alterations in the  metabolism of lipids and pyrimidine nucleotides. It seems that intracellular  calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy; however, a concentrated research effort is required to  understand the primary biochemical lesion in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction in diabetes. In the meantime, a heightened awareness on the part of  clinicians concerning the susceptibility of diabetic patients to cardiovascular  problems may help in reducing mortality and morbidity in the diabetic  population.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Calcium (Ca2+) handling proteins are known to play a pivotal role in  the pathophysiology of cardiomyopathy. However little is known about early  changes in the diabetic heart and the impact of insulin treatment (Ins). METHODS: Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats treated with or without insulin (ZDF ± Ins,  n = 13) and lean littermates (controls, n = 7) were sacrificed at the age of  19 weeks. ZDF + Ins (n = 6) were treated with insulin for the last 6 weeks of life.

However, the effect of diabetes on Ca(2+) regulatory mechanisms in  cardiac endothelial cells (CECs) remains unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of diabetes on [Ca(2+)](i) homeostasis in CECs in  the rat model (streptozotocin-induced) of DCM. DCM-associated cardiac fibrosis  was confirmed using picrosirius red staining of the myocardium.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"Mediator regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to promoters and plays a central role in establishing and maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity."," Context:  CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a master organizer of genome spatial organization  and plays an important role in mediating extensive chromatin interactions.  Circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) is a high-throughput approach that allows genome-wide screening for unknown potential interaction partners. Using a  conserved CTCF binding site on the Bcl11b locus as bait, an interaction partner  at the Arhgap6 locus on a different chromosome was identified by 4C. Additional experiments verified that the interchromatin interaction between the Bcl11b and  Arhgap6 loci was cell-type specific, which was cooperatively mediated by CTCF  and cohesin. Functional analysis showed that the interchromatin interaction  ,  Context: The organization of chromatin within the nucleus and the regulation of  transcription are tightly linked. Recently, mechanisms underlying this  relationship have been uncovered. By defining the organizational hierarchy of  the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with  changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the  context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and  transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin,  CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein  genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity. As such, chromatin organization plays a central role in establishing and  maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome  organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity.  ,  Context: The Mediator complex regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to  promoters. High Mediator binding density defines super enhancers, which regulate  cell-identity genes and oncogenes. Protein interactions of Mediator may explain  its role in these processes but have not been identified comprehensively. Here,  we purify Mediator from neural stem cells (NSCs) and identify 75 protein-protein  interaction partners. We identify super enhancers in NSCs and show that  Mediator-interacting chromatin modifiers colocalize with Mediator at enhancers  and super enhancers. Transcription factor families with high affinity for  Mediator dominate enhancers and super enhancers and can explain genome-wide Mediator localization. We identify E-box transcription factor Tcf4 as a key  regulator of NSCs. Tcf4 interacts with Mediator, colocalizes with Mediator at  super enhancers and regulates neurogenic transcription factor genes with super enhancers and broad H3K4me3 domains. Our data suggest that high binding-affinity  for Mediator is an important organizing feature in the transcriptional network  that determines NSC identity.  ,  Context: The Mediator complex regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to  promoters.

Previous work suggests  regulatory roles for Tail and CKM, but an integrated model for these activities is lacking. Here, we analyzed the genome-wide distribution of Mediator subunits  in wild-type and mutant yeast cells in which RNA polymerase II promoter escape  is blocked, allowing detection of transient Mediator forms. We found that although all modules are recruited to upstream activated regions (UAS), assembly  of Mediator within the pre-initiation complex is accompanied by the release of  CKM. Interestingly, our data show that CKM regulates Mediator-UAS interaction  ,  Context: transduce signals from the transcription activators bound to enhancer regions to  the transcription machinery, which is assembled at promoters as the  preinitiation complex (PIC) to control transcription initiation. Recent  functional studies of Mediator with the use of structural biology approaches and  functional genomics have revealed new insights into Mediator activity and its  regulation during transcription initiation, including how Mediator is recruited  to transcription regulatory regions and how it interacts and cooperates with PIC  components to assist in PIC assembly. Novel roles of Mediator in the control of  gene expression have also been revealed by showing its connection to the nuclear pore and linking Mediator to the regulation of gene positioning in the nuclear  space. Clear links between Mediator subunits and disease have also encouraged  studies to explore targeting of this complex as a potential therapeutic approach in cancer and fungal infections.

Here, we focussed on expanding the  potential of lacticin 3147, one of the most studied lantibiotics and one which  possesses potent activity against a wide range of Gram positive species  including many nosocomial pathogens. More specifically, our aim was to  investigate if lacticin 3147 activity could be enhanced when combined with a  range of different clinical antibiotics.  RESULTS: Initial screening revealed that polymyxin B and polymyxin E (colistin)  exhibited synergistic activity with lacticin 3147. Checkerboard assays were  performed against a number of strains, including both Gram positive and Gram negative species. The resultant fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index  values established that, while partial synergy was detected against Gram  positive targets, synergy was obvious against Gram negative species, including Cronobacter and E. coli.
