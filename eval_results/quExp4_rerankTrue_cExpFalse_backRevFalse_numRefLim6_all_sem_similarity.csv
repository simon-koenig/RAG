The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication. Histone turnover is often associated with various histone modifications such as H3K56 acetylation (H3K56Ac), H3K36 methylation (H3K36me), and H4K20 methylation (H4K20me). We review the signaling pathways and functions associated with a single residue, H4K20, as a model chromatin and clinically important mark that regulates biological processes ranging from the DNA damage response and DNA replication to gene expression and silencing. <CopyrightInformation>© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</C In particular, the methylation states of H3K4, H3K36 and H4K20 have been associated with establishing active, repressed or poised origins depending on the timing and extent of methylation. 5BrC and 5ClC may cause aberrant methylation of cytosine during DNA replication and mimic the endogenous methylation signal associated with gene silencing.","23924899, 20735237, 27268234, 23345616, 27131378, 23754963, 24013172, 26598646, 24049080, 23152447",0.752,[0.723 0.747 0.747 0.747 0.739 0.741],[0.86  0.68  0.68  0.68  0.737 0.877],0.825

BBCAnalyzer is able to visualize base counts at predefined positions or regions in any sequence alignment data that are available as BAM files. Thereby, the tool provides a straightforward solution for evaluating any list of expected mutations like hotspot mutations, or even whole regions of interest. In addition to an ordinary textual report, BBCAnalyzer reports highly customizable plots. Information on the counted number of bases, the reference bases, known mutations or polymorphisms, called mutations and base qualities is summarized in a single plot. By uniting this information in a graphical way, the user may easily decide on a variant being present or not - completely independent of any internal filters or frequency thresholds.",28241736,0.913,[0.342 0.438 0.44  0.44  0.737 0.732],[0.801 0.856 0.545 0.545 0.381 0.367],0.489

HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Through its post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation, senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli.","17392515, 15861128, 23508105, 22201738, 19345675, 23223443, 21816340, 22310293, 21745814, 19289500, 17288991, 23401122, 21164076, 23837869, 19252527, 9763509, 23155001, 14530362, 15543229, 11486028, 15863502, 10673359, 9628881, 16639702, 9155038, 10075998, 9860962, 20007147, 19884656, 15036402, 15824116, 21515253, 12605686, 24152440, 17317627, 22446588, 12242302, 12730239",0.65,[0.708 0.585 0.558 0.5   0.643 0.613],[0.639 0.843 0.667 0.645 0.849 0.739],0.615

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"Mediator occupancy on DNA genome-wide reveals its interaction with specific proteins on the chromatin template, suggesting a link between epigenetic modifications, chromatin structure, and regulatory function."," Context: Nucleosome remodelling complexes play a key role in gene activation in response  to environmental changes by driving promoter chromatin to reach an accessible  configuration. They also mediate genome-wide chromatin organization, although ,  Context: their role in processes other than activation-related chromatin remodelling are  poorly understood. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae ADH2 gene represents an  excellent model for understanding the role of chromatin structure and ,  Context: nucleosome-remodelling complexes that controls the repositioning of nucleosomes.  The RSC complex is expressed abundantly and its 17 subunits are recruited to  chromatin in response to both transcription activation and repression. In the ,  Context: remodelling in gene regulation. Following glucose depletion, highly positioned  promoter nucleosomes are destabilized leading to strictly regulated kinetics of  transcriptional activation. Nevertheless, no chromatin remodelling activities ,  Context: in the genome. Since nucleosomes impact all processes involving the genome, our  results provide a link between epigenetic modifications, chromatin structure,  and regulatory function. ,  Context: from chromatin with chromatin immunoprecipitation in order to reveal Mediator  occupancy on DNA genome-wide, and to identify proteins interacting specifically  with Mediator on the chromatin template.
