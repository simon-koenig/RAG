We studied replacement  ,  Context: Cohesin is a multi-protein complex that tethers sister chromatids during mitosis  and mediates DNA repair, genome compartmentalisation and regulation of gene  expression. Cohesin subunits frequently acquire cancer loss-of-function  alterations and act as tumour suppressors in several tumour types. This has led  to increased interest in cohesin as potential target in anti-cancer therapy.  Here we show that the loss-of-function of STAG2, a core component of cohesin and  an emerging tumour suppressor, leads to synthetic dependency of mutated cancer  cells on its paralog STAG1. STAG1 and STAG2 share high sequence identity, encode  mutually exclusive cohesin subunits and retain partially overlapping functions. We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status. In all cases, we observed that  the simultaneous blocking of STAG1 and STAG2 significantly reduces cell proliferation. We further confirmed the synthetic lethal interaction developing  a vector-free CRISPR system to induce STAG1/STAG2 double gene knockout.

Ipsilateral  use resulted in a higher risk than contralateral mobile and cordless phone use.  Higher ORs were calculated for tumours in the temporal and overlapping lobes.  Using the meningioma cases in the same study as reference entity gave somewhat  higher ORs indicating that the results were unlikely to be explained by recall  or observational bias. This study confirmed previous results of an association  between mobile and cordless phone use and malignant brain tumours. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that RF-EMFs play a role both in the  initiation and promotion stages of carcinogenesis.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Cellphone and cordless phone use is very prevalent among early  adolescents, but the extent and types of use is not well documented. This paper  explores how, and to what extent, New Zealand adolescents are typically using  and exposed to active cellphones and cordless phones, and considers implications  of this in relation to brain tumour risk, with reference to current research  findings. METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited 373 Year 7 and 8 school students with a mean age of 12.3 years (range 10.3-13.7 years) from the Wellington region  of New Zealand. Participants completed a questionnaire and measured their normal  body-to-phone texting distances. Main exposure-metrics included self-reported time spent with an active cellphone close to the body, estimated time and number  of calls on both phone types, estimated and actual extent of SMS text-messaging,  cellphone functions used and people texted. Statistical analyses used Pearson  ,  Context: whereas digital and cordless phones did not overall increase the risk  significantly. Ipsilateral use of analogue phones gave OR=1.7, 95% CI=1.2-2.3,  digital phones OR=1.3, 95% CI=1.02-1.8 and cordless phones OR=1.2, 95%  CI=0.9-1.6. The risk for ipsilateral use was significantly increased for  astrocytoma for all studied phone types, analogue phones OR=1.8,95% CI=1.1-3.2,  digital phones OR=1.8, 95% CI=1.1-2.8, cordless phones OR=1.8, 95% CI=1.1-2.9.  Use of a telephone on the opposite side of the brain was not associated with a  significantly increased risk for brain tumours. Regarding anatomical area of the  tumour and exposure to microwaves, the risk was increased for tumours located in the temporal area on the same side of the brain that was used during phone  calls, significantly so for analogue cellular telephones OR=2.3, 95% CI=1.2-4.1.  For acoustic neurinoma OR=4.4, 95% CI=2.1-9.2 was calculated among analogue cellular telephone users. When duration of use was analysed as a continuous  variable in the total material, the risk increased per year for analogue phones  with OR=1.04, 95% CI=1.01-1.08. For astrocytoma and ipsilateral use the trend  ,  Context: Swedish studies led by Dr. Lennart Hardell. The recent studies reach very  different conclusions. With four exceptions the industry-funded Interphone  studies found no increased risk of brain tumors from cellphone use, while the  Swedish studies, independent of industry funding, reported numerous findings of  significant increased brain tumor risk from cellphone and cordless phone use. An  analysis of the data from the Interphone studies suggests that either the use of  a cellphone protects the user from a brain tumor, or the studies had serious  design flaws. Eleven flaws are identified: (1) selection bias, (2) insufficient  latency time, (3) definition of 'regular' cellphone user, (4) exclusion of young adults and children, (5) brain tumor risk from cellphones radiating higher power  levels in rural areas were not investigated, (6) exposure to other transmitting  sources are excluded, (7) exclusion of brain tumor types, (8) tumors outside the cellphone radiation plume are treated as exposed, (9) exclusion of brain tumor  cases because of death or illness, (10) recall accuracy of cellphone use, and  (11) funding bias.

Does the Oncotype DX test work with paraffin embedded tissues?,"Yes, the Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay works with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks."," Context:  BACKGROUND: The Oncotype DX Colon Cancer Assay is a new diagnostic test for  determining the likelihood of recurrence in stage II colon cancer patients after  surgical resection using fixed paraffin embedded (FPE) primary colon tumor tissue. Like the Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay, this is a high complexity,  multi-analyte, reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay  that measures the expression levels of specific cancer-related genes. By capturing the biology underlying each patient's tumor, the Oncotype DX Colon  Cancer Assay provides a Recurrence Score (RS) that reflects an individualized  risk of disease recurrence.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,Lewy body disease is a disorder characterized by the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the brainstem.," Context:  Parkinson's disease (PD) and related Lewy body diseases are characterized by  deposition of α-synuclein aggregates in both the central nervous system and  peripheral nervous system. Synucleinopathy lesions spread to larger brain areas as the disease progresses, and prion-like cell-to-cell transmission of  aggregated α-synuclein is thought to be the underlying mechanism for this  pathological spreading. LRRK2 is another protein linked to the pathogenesis of PD, and its presence in Lewy bodies has attracted much attention as to whether  LRRK2 and α-synuclein interplay during the pathogenesis of PD. However, the  relationship between these two crucial proteins still remains unclear. In this  ,  Context: Lewy bodies are intraneuronal inclusions initially found in the pigmented  brainstem nuclei of patients with Parkinson's disease. Their aspect varies  according to their neuronal or cerebral situation. They have been a long time  the hallmark of Parkinson's disease, but in recent years it has emerged that a  small group of rare disorders or rare variants of common degenerative diseases  are also sometimes associated with Lewy bodies in the nervous system.  Pathological studies have also individualized a new disorder characterized by  the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the  brainstem: Lewy body disease. The clinical syndrome associates dementia, parkinsonian features, dysautonomia and motor neuron disease. The dementia is  cortical in type and psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations or  delusions are frequent. The pathological features are nerve cell loss, diffuse Lewy bodies, and sometimes senile plaques.

AF-LB and  Parkinson's disease (PD) share the neuropathological findings characterized by  widely distributed Lewy bodies in the central nervous system including the  substantia nigra and locus coeruleus. However, clinical manifestations of AF-LB  are far different from PD in which autonomic dysfunction, if present, is not a predominant feature. In the present study, clinical features were comparatively  analysed in AF-LB and PD to investigate the nosological relation between PD and  AF-LB. The subjects were 94 patients with PD and 11 reported cases of AF-LB in the literature. A test of 70 degrees passive head-up tilt was performed upon the  patients with PD in our laboratory.

The NoSAS Score can be used for screening of which disorders?,The NoSAS score can be used for screening of Sleep-Disordered Breathing (SDB) and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).," Context: RESULTS: A total of 450 patients were included in the study. The sensitivity,  specificity, PPV, and NPV of the NoSAS score were 81%, 51.2%, 88.2%, and 37.5%  for an AHI (apnea–hypopnea index) ≥ 5 event/h and 84.5%, 38.2%, 66%, and 63.4%  for an AHI ≥ 15 event/h, respectively. AUC percentages for the NoSAS score,  STOP-Bang questionnaire, Berlin questionnaire, and ESS were 0.740, 0.737, 0.626,  and 0.571 for an AHI ≥ 5 events/h and 0.715, 0.704, 0.574, and 0.621 for an AHI  ≥ 30 events/h. The NoSAS score had a false negative rate of 2.9% for severe SDB. CONCLUSION: The NoSAS score had a good degree of differentiation for SDB and can  be used as an easily applicable, subjective, and effective screening tool in a sleep clinical population in Turkey. Not only in moderate to severe SDB but also  in mild SDB, the NoSAS score performed better than the other 3 screening tools.  ,  Context: current MDE. Using a threshold of ≥ 8 points, the NoSAS score identified OSAS in  MDE participants with a sensitivity of 0.79, a specificity of 0.66, a negative  predictive value of 0.91, and a positive predictive value of 0.41. The area  under the ROC curve was 0.72 for NoSAS, 0.66 for STOP-BANG and 0.69 for the  Berlin score (NS). LIMITATIONS: Only 44% of the PsyCoLaus participants had a polysomnography. The  studied population was mainly of Caucasian ancestry and above 40 years of age.  CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study assessing the performance of screening  tools for OSAS in MDE. The NoSAS score is a simple and efficient screening tool  for OSAS in this population, and may be a helpful instrument for clinicians.  ,  Context: male. Using a threshold of 8 points or more, the NoSAS score identified  individuals at risk of clinically significant sleep-disordered breathing, with  an area under the curve (AUC) of 0·74 (95% CI 0·72-0·76). It showed an even  higher performance in the EPISONO cohort, with an AUC of 0·81 (0·77-0·85). The  NoSAS score performed significantly better than did the STOP-Bang (AUC 0·67 [95%  CI 0·65-0·69]; p<0·0001) and Berlin (0·63 [0·61-0·66]; p<0·0001) scores.  INTERPRETATION: The NoSAS score is a simple, efficient, and easy to implement  score enabling identification of individuals at risk of sleep-disordered  breathing. Because of its high discrimination power, the NoSAS score can help clinicians to decide which patients to further investigate with a nocturnal  recording. FUNDING: Faculty of Biology and Medicine of the University of Lausanne, Lausanne  University Hospital, Swiss National Science Foundation, Leenaards Foundation, GlaxoSmithKline, and Vaud Pulmonary League.  ,  Context: recommended. We aimed to develop a screening tool allowing identification of  individuals at risk of sleep-disordered breathing. METHODS: We used the participants from the population-based HypnoLaus cohort in  Lausanne, Switzerland, who had a clinical assessment and polysomnography at  home, to build a clinical score (the NoSAS score) using multiple factor analysis  and logistic regression to identify people likely to have clinically significant  sleep-disordered breathing. The NoSAS score was externally validated in an  independent sleep cohort (EPISONO). We compared its performance to existing  screening scores (STOP-Bang and Berlin scores). FINDINGS: We used the 2121 participants from the HypnoLaus cohort who were  assessed between Sept 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013. The NoSAS score, which ranges  from 0 to 17, allocates 4 points for having a neck circumference of more than 40 cm, 3 points for having a body-mass index of 25 kg/m(2) to less than 30 kg/m(2)  or 5 points for having a body-mass index of 30 kg/m(2) or more, 2 points for  snoring, 4 points for being older than 55 years of age, and 2 points for being  ,  Context: questionnaires were collected, after which the NoSAS score was compared against  the other questionnaires for SDB screening. RESULTS: A total of 2,208 participants were enrolled in this study. The NoSAS  scores, which ranged from 0 to 17 and allocated a threshold of 8 points,  identified individuals at risk of clinically significant SDB (defined as an  apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] cutoff of ≥ 20 events/h), with an area under the  curve (AUC) of 0.707. The NoSAS score performed significantly better than the  STOP (AUC 0.655) and STOP-Bang (AUC 0.704) questionnaires and the ESS (AUC  0.642), and it was at par with the Berlin (AUC 0.697) scores for SDB screening. A significant correlation was found between the AHI and NoSAS score (r = .386, P  < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The NoSAS score is a simple, efficient, and easy method for  screening SDB in the clinical setting, especially in moderate to severe SDB. It demonstrates a moderately high level of sensitivity for SDB.  ,  Context: results, patients were divided into non-osa group （AHI<5） 93 cases and OSA group  251 cases. The OSA group were divided into mild （AHI 5-15）, moderate（AHI 16-30）  and severe OSA group（AHI>30） according to the PSG result. The ROC curve was  plotted to evaluate the screening value of NoSAS and improved Mallampati grading  combined with NoSAS for OSA. Result:With the NoSAS score of 8 or 9 as cutoffs  for analysis, the sensitivity for OSA was 0.733 and 0.701; the specificity for  OSA was 0.538 and 0.624, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of NoSAS  combined with improved Mallampati grading for screening OSA were 0.813 and  0.710, respectively. Conclusion:As a new screening tool, NoSAS questionnaire is simple and convenient, and has certain screening value to OSA. The improved  Mallampati grading combined with NoSAS questionnaire can obviously improve the  screening sensitivity and specificity of Osa, and has higher application value.

Our results indicate that the  overall strength of genetic hitchhiking--the degree to which expected  heterozygosity decreases--is diminished by population subdivision, mainly  because opportunity for the breakdown of hitchhiking by recombination increases  as the spread of the beneficial mutation across demes is delayed when migration  rate is much smaller than the strength of selection. Furthermore, the amount of  genetic variation after a selective sweep is expected to be unequal over demes: a greater reduction in expected heterozygosity occurs in the subpopulation from  which the beneficial mutation originates than in its neighboring subpopulations.

Recent methodologies have enabled in-depth  characterization of circRNAs for identification and potential functions.  CircRNAs play important roles in various biological functions as microRNA  sponges, transcriptional regulators and combining with RNA binding proteins.  Recent studies indicated that some cytoplasmic circRNAs can be effectively  translated into detectable peptides, which enlightened us on the importance of  circRNAs in cellular physiology function. Internal Ribosome Entry site (IRES)-  and N6-methyladenosines (m6A)-mediated cap-independent translation initiation have been suggested to be potential mechanism for circRNA translation. To date,  several translated circRNAs have been uncovered to play pivotal roles in human  cancers. In this review, we introduced the properties and functions of circRNAs, and characterized the possible mechanism of translation initiation and  complexity of the translation ability of circRNAs. We summarized the emerging  functions of circRNA-encoded proteins in human cancer. The works on circRNA  ,  Context: SUMMARY: Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of endogenous RNAs, are  widespread in eukaryotic cells. Emerging roles in diverse biological processes  suggest that circRNA is a promising key player in RNA world. Most circRNAs are  generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, forming a covalently closed loop  structure with no 5' caps or 3' polyadenylated tails. In addition, most circRNAs  were not associated with translating ribosomes, therefore, circRNAs were deemed  to be noncoding. However, the latest research findings revealed that some  circRNAs could generate proteins in vivo, which expands the landscape of  transcriptome and proteome. To gain insights into the new area of circRNA translation, we introduce an integrated tool capable of detecting circRNAs with  protein-coding potential from high-throughput sequencing data.

Proteolytic maturation of this precursor protein is  performed by the proteasome complex. Here we show that Tax binds specifically to  two subunits of the 20S proteasome, HsN3 and HC9. This interaction is weakened  with HsN3 and lost for HC9 when a mutant of Tax is substituted that is  selectively defective for NF-kappa B activation. Immunoprecipitation shows that  p1O5 binds weakly to HC9 and that this interaction is reinforced by Tax. No bridging function of Tax between p1O5 and HsN3 was observed. From these results,  we propose that Tax accelerates the proteolytic maturation of P105 by favouring  its anchorage to the proteasome.  ,  Context: METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and oncology conference proceedings were searched for  relevant studies. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials of cancer  patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors with adequate data on hepatic AEs.  RESULTS: A total of nine randomized controlled trials with a variety of solid  tumors were eligible for the meta-analysis. The use of PD-1 inhibitors  significantly increased the risk of developing all-grade hepatic AEs but not for  high-grade hepatic AEs in comparison with chemotherapy or everolimus control.  Additionally, the risk of all-grade and high-grade hepatic AEs with a  nivolumab/ipilimumab combination was substantially higher than ipilimumab. No significant differences in the risk of all-grade and high-grade hepatic AEs were  found between PD-1 inhibitors monotherapy and ipilimumab. CONCLUSION: While the use of PD-1 inhibitors is associated with an increased risk of developing hepatic AEs in cancer patients, this is primarily for lower  grade events.  ,  Context: II/III trials for psoriasis and PsA. AREAS COVERED: Bimekizumab is not currently licensed for use.

EXPERT OPINION: Clinical trials of bimekizumab have been promising,  demonstrating a rapid onset of response and superior efficacy compared to three  currently licensed biologics: secukinumab, ustekinumab, and adalimumab.  Bimekizumab maintains a high level of efficacy with maintenance dosing intervals  of 8 weeks, compared with 4 weeks for currently licensed IL-17A antagonists. No unexpected adverse events have been identified, although mild-to-moderate fungal  infections occur in approximately 10%.

What is Hemophilic Pseudotumor?,"Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare lesion that is essentially a progressive, slowly expanding, encapsulated hematoma, usually seen in 1-2% patients with severe coagulative disorder. It occurs in soft tissues, muscles, tend"," Context:  Hemophilic pseudotumor is an encapsulated, chronic, slowly expanding hematoma  usually seen in 1-2% patients with severe coagulative disorder (James et al.,  2003). It usually occurs in soft tissues, muscles, tendons, and subperiosteal part of the bones. It slowly enlarges, develops a fibrous capsule, and destroys  underlying tissues by progressive necrosis (James et al., 2003). Hemophilia is  an X chromosome-linked hereditary disorder caused by defective synthesis or synthesis of dysfunctional factor VIII molecules (Harold et al., 2006).  ,  Context:  Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare lesion that is essentially a progressive,  slowly expanding, encapsulated hematoma. It is estimated to affect 1% to 2% of  severe hemophiliacs. The majority of hemophilic pseudotumors occur within soft tissues (intramuscular) and long bones of adult males. Fewer than 20 cases have  been reported in the maxillofacial region.

We present the case  of a male toddler with moderate hemophilia A and cranial hemophilic pseudotumor  managed with factor VIII infusions. We also provide a review of the literature. Recognition of this rare manifestation of this complication of hemophilia is  important to provide correct treatment and avoid unnecessary investigations,  particularly biopsy, which is contraindicated in this condition.  ,  Context:  Hemophilic pseudotumor is an uncommon complication seen in approximately 1-2% of  patients with severe hemophilia. Hemophilic pseudotumors are distinguished into  two subdivisions based on location, proximal or distal. Plain x-rays and CT are useful in diagnosis, but MR imaging is the diagnostic test of choice because of  its sensitivity to the various blood products. The choice of therapy depends on  many parameters, such as the size of the tumor, the age of the patient, and the relation with underlying organs. In most cases of asymptomatic hemophilic  pseudotumor, conservative treatment with administration of missing factor as  well as immobilization is recommended.

List symptoms of the Hakim Triad?,"Dementia, gait disturbances, and urinary incontinence."," Context:  Triad of Hakim--Adams is well known for normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH):  dementia, gait disturbances and urinary incontinence. Variability of intensity  of these symptoms is obvious. However in clinical practice all classic signs are present. We describe a case of posttraumatic NPH producing only gait impairment  with intact intellect and memory and bladder function. Such reports were not  found in literature.  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a chronic neurological  disorder characterized by enlarged ventricles and a triad of clinical symptoms  affecting gait, cognition, and urinary continence.

In these cases, we performed a preoperative and postoperative survey  of sexual activity. RESULTS: In the preoperative period, all 28 patients reported having no sexual  activity or arousal, from 2 to 4 years before the operation. Following shunt  placement, 22/28 (78.5%) of patients regained variable sexual desire within a  period ranging from 3 to 8 weeks, affording normal sexual activity with their  partner.  CONCLUSIONS: Sexual dysfunction can be part of the very early clinical  background in patients with Hakim's triad and neuroradiological imaging  compatible with chronic hydrocephalus. Restoration of sexual ability and arousal should be considered among the postoperative goals in these cases, together with  improvements in cognition, gait, and urinary continence.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is a type of  communicating hydrocephalus also known as non-obstructive hydrocephalus. This  type of hydrocephalus is caused by impaired cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption  without any obstruction in the ventricular system and is associated with normal  cerebrospinal fluid pressure. It is characterised clinically by gait  disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and urinary incontinence (known as the  Hakim-Adams triad). The exact cause of iNPH is unknown. It may be managed  conservatively or treated surgically by inserting a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) or  ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt. However, a substantial number of patients do not respond well to surgical treatment, complication rates are high and there is  often a need for further surgery. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an  alternative surgical intervention. It has been suggested that ETV may lead to better outcomes, including fewer complications.

Thirty-two patients with histologically proven pheo or  paraganglionoma were evaluated. Around 84.4% patients had adrenal pheos and 15.6% had extra-adrenal pheos. Two patients had bilateral adrenal tumors, two  had a history of prior pheos, and four had a family history of pheo. There were  19 (59.4%) female and 13 (40.6%) male patients.

RESULTS: We use the ENCODE data to scan DNA functional elements, including  chromatin accessibility and histone modification, around transcript cleavage sites.

However, these polyadenylation sites have preference in  nucleosome-depleted regions, indicating the involvement of chromatin  ,  Context: proximal sites or the unique sites of genes using only one polyadenylation site.  We also observe that the histone modification mark, histone H3 lysine 36  tri-methylation (H3K36Me3), exhibits different patterns around the cleavage  sites of genes using multiple polyadenylation sites from those of genes using a  single polyadenylation site. Surprisingly, the H3K36Me3 levels are comparable  among the alternative polyadenylation sites themselves. In summary,  polyadenylation and alternative polyadenylation are closely related to  functional elements on the DNA level.

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel, life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition that develops in children a few weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have evidence of a marked inflammatory state.

Although microtubules play a pivotal  role in organizing cellular structure, regulation of microtubule dynamics during  adipogenesis remains unclear. In the present paper we show that acetylation of  α-tubulin is up-regulated during adipogenesis, and adipocyte development is  dependent on α-tubulin acetylation, as expression of an acetylation-resistant  α-tubulin mutant significantly inhibits adipogenesis. Moreover, acetylation of  α-tubulin is under the control of the acetyltransferase MEC-17 and deacetylases  SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6). Adipocyte development is inhibited in MEC-17-knockdown cells, but enhanced in MEC-17-overexpressing  cells. Finally, we show that katanin, a microtubule-severing protein with  enhanced activity on acetylated α-tubulin, is actively involved in adipogenesis.

From this perspective, recent evidence suggests that stimulating  macrophage's pro-resolving functions using SPMs can promote inflammation  resolution in cancer and improve anticancer treatments. Thus, TAMs' re-education  toward an antitumor phenotype by using SPMs opens a new line of attack in cancer  treatment.

Macrophages are key actors of both inflammation and its  active resolution due to their plastic phenotype.

In most solid cancers, increased infiltration  with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) has long been associated with poor  patient prognosis, highlighting their value as potential diagnostic and  prognostic biomarkers in cancer. A number of macrophage-centered approaches to  anticancer therapy have been investigated, and include strategies to block their  tumor-promoting activities or exploit their antitumor effector functions.  Integrating therapeutic strategies to target TAMs to complement conventional  therapies has yielded promising results in preclinical trials and warrants  further investigation to determine its translational benefit in human cancer patients. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying the  pro-tumorigenic programming of macrophages and provide a comprehensive update of  macrophage-targeted therapies for the treatment of solid cancers.  ,  Context: strategy for cancer therapy. To date, TAM targeting strategies have focused on  macrophage depletion and inhibition of their recruitment into the TME. However,  these strategies have shown limited therapeutic efficacy, although trials are  still underway with combination therapies. The fact that macrophages have the  potential for antitumor activity has moved the TAM targeting field toward the  development of TAM-reprogramming strategies to support this antitumor immune  response. Here, we discuss the various roles of TAMs in cancer therapy and their  immunosuppressive properties, as well as implications for emerging checkpoint  inhibitor-based immunotherapies. We review state-of-the-art TAM-targeting strategies, focusing on current ones at the preclinical and clinical trial  stages that aim to reprogram TAMs as an oncological therapy.  ,  Context: infiltration is generally associated with poor prognosis, but macrophages are  highly plastic cells that can adopt either proinflammatory/antitumor or  anti-inflammatory/protumor features in response to tumor microenvironment  stimuli. In the context of cancer therapy, many anticancer therapeutics, apart  from their direct effect on tumor cells, display different effects on TAM  activation status and density. In this review, we aim to evaluate the indirect  effects of anticancer therapies in the modulation of TAM phenotypes and  pro/antitumor activity.  ,  Context: infiltration is generally associated with poor prognosis, but macrophages are  highly plastic cells that can adopt either proinflammatory/antitumor or  anti-inflammatory/protumor features in response to tumor microenvironment  stimuli.

Obstacles to the development of saturated  transposon libraries have previously limited transposon mutant-based screens as  well as essential gene studies. We have developed a system for efficient  transposon mutagenesis of P. gingivalis using a modified mariner transposon.  Tn-seq is a technique that allows for quantitative assessment of individual mutants within a transposon mutant library by sequencing the transposon-genome  junctions and then compiling mutant presence by mapping to a base genome. Using  Tn-seq, it is possible to quickly define all the insertional mutants in a library and thus identify nonessential genes under the conditions in which the  library was produced. Identification of fitness of individual mutants under  specific conditions can be performed by exposing the library to selective  pressures.  ,  Context: AIM: To develop a reliable method for whole genome analysis of DNA methylation. MATERIALS & METHODS: Genome-scale analysis of DNA methylation includes  affinity-based approaches such as enrichment using methyl-CpG-binding proteins.  One of these methods, the methylated-CpG island recovery assay (MIRA), is based  on the high affinity of the MBD2b-MBD3L1 complex for CpG-methylated DNA. Here we  provide a detailed description of MIRA and combine it with next generation  sequencing platforms (MIRA-seq). RESULTS: We assessed the performance of MIRA-seq and compared the data with  whole genome bisulfite sequencing. CONCLUSION: MIRA-seq is a reliable, genome-scale DNA methylation analysis platform for scoring DNA methylation differences at CpG-rich genomic regions.

This disorder, a primary genetic cardiomyopathy, is now attracting  increased attention. METHOD: The current state of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of NCCM are discussed on  the basis of a review of selected literature as well as the authors' personal  experience. RESULTS: The pathogenesis of NCCM is thought to involve a genetically determined disturbance of the myocardial compaction process during fetal endomyocardial  morphogenesis.

At the time of discharge the patient had no residual  neurological deficits. CONCLUSION: Isolated ventricular non-compaction is a rare type of  cardiomyopathy. Possible manifestations include systemic embolic events,  arrhythmias and heart failure. Echocardiography is the investigation of choice in identifying characteristic changes.  ,  Context: PATIENT: Male, 22 FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Cardiomyopathy Symptoms: Shortness of breath  • dispnoea • chest discomfort MEDICATION: - Clinical Procedure: Echocardiogram • cardiac MRI Specialty:  Cardiology. OBJECTIVE: Challenging differential diagnosis.  BACKGROUND: Non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCM) is a rare congenital  cardiomyopathy characterized by increased trabeculation in one or more segments  of the ventricle. The left ventricle is most commonly affected. However, biventricular involvement or right ventricle predominance has also been  described. Clinical features of NCM are non-specific and can range from being  asymptomatic to symptoms of congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, and systemic  thromboembolism. CASE REPORT: 22-year-old Hispanic male presented with two month history of chest  discomfort. Laboratory workup revealed an elevated brain-natriuretic-peptide of  1768 pg/ml. ECG and chest x-ray was nonspecific. Transthoracic echocardiogram  ,  Context: OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the role of Cypher/ZASP in the pathogenesis of dilated  cardiomyopathy (DCM) with or without isolated non-compaction of the left  ventricular myocardium (INLVM).  BACKGROUND: Dilated cardiomyopathy, characterized by left ventricular dilation  and systolic dysfunction with signs of heart failure, is genetically transmitted  in 30% to 40% of cases. Genetic heterogeneity has been identified with mutations in multiple cytoskeletal and sarcomeric genes causing the phenotype. In  addition, INLVM with a hypertrophic dilated left ventricle, ventricular  dysfunction, and deep trabeculations, is also inherited, and the genes identified to date differ from those causing DCM. Cypher/ZASP is a newly  identified gene encoding a protein that is a component of the Z-line in both  skeletal and cardiac muscle.  ,  Context: PURPOSE: Delayed enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance (DE-CMR) can  detect cardiac scarring and has the potential to visualize the progression of  myocardial remodeling. We determined whether DE-CMR can predict cardiac events  in dilated cardiomyopathy patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transthoracic echocardiography, coronary arteriography,  and DE-CMR studies were performed in 60 consecutive dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients. Percent delayed enhancement (%DE) was determined as the ratio of the  area showing delayed enhancement to the total myocardial area in three  short-axis views. Patients were classified as advanced group (Group A) when %DE was 10% or higher, and as non-advanced group (Group NA) when %DE was less than  10%. The incidence of cardiac events and the clinical history were compared  between Group A and Group NA.

Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?,POLQ gene encodes DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) in mammalian cells.," Context:  DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is an evolutionarily conserved protein encoded by  the POLQ gene in mammalian genomes. Pol θ is the defining enzyme for a pathway  of DSB repair termed ""alternative end-joining"" (altEJ) or ""theta-mediated end-joining."" This pathway contributes significantly to the radiation resistance  of mammalian cells. It also modulates accuracy in repair of breaks that occur at  stalled DNA replication forks, during diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, during repair of CRISPR-Cas9, and in many DNA integration events.  Pol θ is a potentially important clinical target, particularly for cancers  deficient in other break repair strategies. The enzyme is uniquely able to  ,  Context:  DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi. Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The  C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a  helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol θ is important in  the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks  arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during  diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by  ,  Context:  DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi.

Multisegment  cGOFs were further classified into symmetric or asymmetric according to segment  orientations toward the origin-terminus axis. The cGOFs in Gram-positive species  are exclusively symmetric and often reversible in orientation, as opposed to  those of the Gram-negative bacteria, which are all asymmetric and irreversible.  Meanwhile, all species showing strong strand-biased gene distribution contain  symmetric cGOFs and often specific DnaE (α subunit of DNA polymerase III)  isoforms. Furthermore, functional evaluations revealed that cGOF genes are hub  associated with regard to cellular activities, and the stability of cGOF provides efficient indexes for scaffold orientation as demonstrated by  assembling virtual and empirical genome drafts. cGOFs show species specificity,  and the symmetry of multisegmental cGOFs is conserved among taxa and constrained by DNA polymerase-centric strand-biased gene distribution. The definition of  species-specific cGOFs provides powerful guidance for genome assembly and other  structure-based analysis.  ,  Context:  DNA polymerase alpha (pol alpha) holds a special position among the growing  family of eukaryotic DNA polymerases. In fact, pol alpha is associated with DNA  primase to form a four subunit complex and, as a consequence, is the only enzyme able to start DNA synthesis de novo. Because of this peculiarity the major role  of the DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex (pol-prim) is in the initiation of  DNA replication at chromosomal origins and in the discontinuous synthesis of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand of the replication fork. However,  pol-prim seems to play additional roles in other complex cellular processes,  such as the response to DNA damage, telomere maintenance, and the epigenetic  ,  Context: To elucidate the behavior of DNA polymerase eta against the oxidized purine  nucleotides, we determined the utilization efficiency of 2-hydroxy-dATP and  8-hydroxy-dGTP by the recombinant yeast DNA polymerase eta using the primer  extension assay with the synthetic oligonucleotide template-primers, and  compared those by DNA polymerase alpha. Results indicate that DNA polymerase eta  incorporates 2-hydroxy-dATP opposite template G in addition to template T and 8-hydroxy-dGTP opposite A in addition to C, respectively. Kinetic analysis  revealed that the rate of mutation caused by 2-OH-dATP and 8-OH-dGTP with DNA  polymerase eta should be much higher than those with DNA polymerase alpha.

How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"Rif1 regulates DNA replication timing through a mechanism independent of the intra-S checkpoint signaling.

Analysis of pfa4Δ cells, which are defective in  palmitoylation and membrane association of Rif1, suggests that replication  timing regulation by Rif1 is independent of its role in localizing telomeres to  the nuclear periphery. Intra-S checkpoint signaling is intact in rif1Δ cells,  and checkpoint-defective mec1Δ cells do not comparably deregulate replication  timing, together indicating that Rif1 regulates replication timing through a  mechanism independent of this checkpoint. Our results indicate that the Rif1  mechanism regulates origin timing irrespective of proximity to a chromosome end, and suggest instead that telomere sequences merely provide abundant binding  sites for proteins that recruit Rif1. Still, the abundance of Rif1 binding in  telomeric domains may facilitate Rif1-mediated repression of non-telomeric origins that are more distal from centromeres.  ,  Context: The eukaryotic genome is replicated according to a specific spatio-temporal  programme. However, little is known about both its molecular control and  biological significance. Here, we identify mouse Rif1 as a key player in the  regulation of DNA replication timing. We show that Rif1 deficiency in primary  cells results in an unprecedented global alteration of the temporal order of  replication. This effect takes place already in the first S-phase after Rif1 deletion and is neither accompanied by alterations in the transcriptional  landscape nor by major changes in the biochemical identity of constitutive  heterochromatin. In addition, Rif1 deficiency leads to both defective G1/S transition and chromatin re-organization after DNA replication. Together, these  data offer a novel insight into the global regulation and biological  significance of the replication-timing programme in mammalian cells.

Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1 colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at early-S-phase. Overall, Rif1 plays crucial roles in determining the replication timing domain structures in human cells through regulating higher-order chromatin architecture.

Is H4K20 methylation associated with DNA replication?,"H4K20 methylation is linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair, and DNA replication.

Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated  histone methyltransferase PR-Set7.

Coincident with the ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest, we find increased  ,  Context: chromatin during S-phase, but only regions with H3K79 methylation in G1 and G2  were enriched in replication initiation events. H3K79 was dimethylated in a  region containing a functional replicator (a DNA sequence capable of initiating  DNA replication), but the methylation was not evident in a mutant replicator  that could not initiate replication. Depletion of DOT1L, the sole enzyme  responsible for H3K79 methylation, triggered limited genomic over-replication  although most cells could continue to proliferate and replicate DNA in the  absence of methylated H3K79. Thus, prevention of H3K79 methylation might affect  regulatory processes that modulate the order and timing of DNA replication. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that dimethylated H3K79 associates  with some replication origins and marks replicated chromatin during S-phase to  prevent re-replication and preserve genomic stability.  ,  Context: Residue and degree-specific methylation of histone lysines along with other  epigenetic modifications organizes chromatin into distinct domains and regulates  almost every aspect of DNA metabolism. Identification of histone  methyltransferases and demethylases, as well as proteins that recognize  methylated lysines, has clarified the role of each methylation event in  regulating different biological pathways. Methylation of histone H4 lysine 20  (H4K20me) plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes such as gene  expression, cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair, with each of the three  degrees of methylation (mono-, di- and tri-methylation) making a unique contribution. Here we discuss recent studies of H4K20me that have greatly  improved our understanding of the regulation and function of this fascinating  histone modification.  ,  Context:  H4K20 monomethylation maintains genome integrity by regulating proper mitotic  condensation, DNA damage response, and replication licensing. Here, we show  that, in non-dividing hepatic cells, H4K20Me1 is specifically enriched in active gene bodies and dynamically regulated by the antagonistic action of Kmt5a  methylase and Kdm7b demethylase. In liver-specific Kmt5a-deficient mice, reduced  levels of H4K20Me1 correlated with reduced RNA Pol II release from promoter-proximal regions.

Consistent with these activities, the HCF-1C subunit can associate with  chromatin independently of the HCF-1N subunit and regulates the expression of  the H4-K20 methyltransferase PR-Set7. Indeed, upregulation of PR-Set7 expression  upon loss of HCF-1 leads to improper mitotic H4-K20 methylation and cytokinesis  defects. These results establish the HCF-1C subunit as an important M phase  regulator and suggest that H4-K20 methylation status contributes to chromosome  behavior during mitosis and proper cytokinesis.

The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.

DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar searches (1966 to July 2013) were  conducted using the key words: avanafil, erectile dysfunction, and  phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles evaluating avanafil for erectile  dysfunction (ED) published in English and using human subjects were selected.  Five clinical trials were identified. References cited in identified articles  ,  Context: METHODS: A PubMed search was completed to find articles published in English  studying patient satisfaction and adherence to ED medication. Additional  searches looked specifically for any data regarding the use of avanafil.  RESULTS: ED is effectively treated in most patients with PDE5Is, with the most  common side effects from the medications being headache, flushing, and visual  disturbances. Patients have identified many different factors, such as efficacy,  side effects, duration of action, and daily use, in determining overall  satisfaction and the right medication for them. While avanafil does not have any  patient satisfaction trials to date, it has been proven to be a safe and effective treatment for ED with possibly the fastest onset of action and fewer  visual disturbances than its competitors. CONCLUSION: Avanafil along with the other PDE5Is has shown to be a safe and effective oral treatment for ED, with avanafil's possible place in therapy for  patients who want an on-demand option or as an alternative in patients who  experience visual disturbances with the other agents.  ,  Context: diastereomers in animals or humans.

Specifically, mRNA for the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) was detected in"," Context: their receptors are of any value in distinguishing pulmonary carcinoids from  carcinoids of intestinal origin. METHODS: Carcinoid tumors with pulmonary (no.=9) or intestinal (no.=15)  localizations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, autoradiography, and  radioimmunoassay, to examine the presence of bombesin receptor subtypes and  determine BLP levels in these tumors.  RESULTS: All 3 bombesin receptor subtypes (GRPR, NMBR, and BRS-3) were present  on pulmonary and intestinal carcinoids by immunohistochemistry. In pulmonary  carcinoids, low receptor ligand binding densities together with high and low BLP levels were found. Intestinal carcinoids showed predominantly high receptor  ligand binding densities in combination with low BLP levels.

Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?,Mutational biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C) are introduced due to directional mutation pressure.," Context: Using a general form of the directional mutation theory, this paper analyzes the  effect of mutations in mutator genes on the G+C content of DNA, the frequency of  substitution mutations, and evolutionary changes (cumulative mutations) under  various degrees of selective constraints. Directional mutation theory predicts  that when the mutational bias between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs is  equilibrated with the base composition of a neutral set of DNA nucleotides, the mutation frequency per gene will be much lower than the frequency immediately  after the mutator mutation takes place. This prediction explains the wide  variation of the DNA G+C content among unicellular organisms and possibly also the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of third codon positions for the genes of  multicellular eukaryotes. The present analyses lead to several predictions that  are not consistent with a number of the frequently held assumptions in the field  ,  Context: expected to be A = T and G = C at equilibrium without regard to the G + C  content of DNA (type 2 parity rule or PR2). Significant deviations from the  parity rules in the third codon letters of the four-codon amino acids result  mostly from selective biases rather than mutational biases between the two  strands of DNA during evolution. The parity rules lay the foundation for  evaluating the biases in synonymous codon usage in terms of (1) directional  mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational  biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias  mutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional selection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance. The present analysis  shows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of  four-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C content of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly  counteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C  content.  ,  Context: expected to be A = T and G = C at equilibrium without regard to the G + C  content of DNA (type 2 parity rule or PR2).

Such pressure led to changes in species-specific usages of codons and tRNA anticodons, and also in amino acid  assignments of codons in mitochondria and in several intact organisms. These  code changes are probably recent evolutionary events. The genetic code is not 'frozen', but instead it is still evolving.  ,  Context: When there are no biases in mutation and selection between the two strands of  DNA, the 12 possible substitution rates of the four nucleotides reduces to six  (type 1 parity rule or PR1), and the intrastrand average base composition is  expected to be A = T and G = C at equilibrium without regard to the G + C  content of DNA (type 2 parity rule or PR2).

Now that DNA  sequence data are available, the theory allows the estimation of the extent of  neutrality of directional mutation pressure against selection. Newly defined  parameters were used in the analysis, and two apparently universal constants  were discovered. Analysis of DNA sequence has revealed that practically all  organisms are subject to directional mutation pressure. The theory also offers plausible explanations for the large heterogeneity in guanine-plus-cytosine  content among different parts of the vertebrate genome.

Which genes are associated with autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth?,Dynamin 2 (DNM2) is associated with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy.," Context:  Autosomal recessive hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy or  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a severe childhood-onset neuromuscular  disorder. Autosomal recessive CMT is genetically heterogeneous with one locus mapped to chromosome 11p15 (CMT4B2). The histopathological hallmarks of CMT4B2  are focal outfoldings of myelin in nerve biopsies. Homozygosity mapping, in a  Turkish inbred family with four children affected by CMT characterized by focally folded myelin, provided linkage to the CMT4B2 locus. We identified a  large, novel gene, named SET binding factor 2 (SBF2), that lies within this  interval and is expressed in various tissues, including spinal cord and  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) neuropathy is a heterogeneous group of  inherited disorders of the peripheral nervous system. The authors recently  mapped an autosomal dominant demyelinating form of CMT type 1 (CMT1C) to  chromosome 16p13.1-p12.3. OBJECTIVE: To find the gene mutations underlying CMT1C. METHODS: The authors used a combination of standard positional cloning and  candidate gene approaches to identify the causal gene for CMT1C. Western blot analysis was used to determine relative protein levels in patient and control  lymphocyte extracts. Northern blotting was used to characterize gene expression  in 1) multiple tissues; 2) developing sciatic nerve; and 3) nerve-crush and  ,  Context: OBJECTIVES: To determine the nature and frequency of HSJ1 mutations in patients  with hereditary motor and hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies. METHODS: Patients were screened for mutations by genome-wide or targeted linkage  and homozygosity studies, whole-exome sequencing, and Sanger sequencing. RNA and  protein studies of skin fibroblasts were used for functional characterization. RESULTS: We describe 2 additional mutations in the HSJ1 gene in a cohort of 90  patients with autosomal recessive distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN) and  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2). One family with a dHMN phenotype  showed the homozygous splice-site mutation c.229+1G>A, which leads to retention of intron 4 in the HSJ1 messenger RNA with a premature stop codon and loss of  protein expression. Another family, presenting with a CMT2 phenotype, carried  the homozygous missense mutation c.14A>G (p.Tyr5Cys).

Many PMP22  mutants accumulate in excess in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lead to the  inherited neuropathies of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. However, the  mechanism through which PMP22 mutants accumulate in the ER is unknown. Here, we  studied the quality control mechanisms for the PMP22 mutants L16P and G150D, which were originally identified in mice and patients with CMT. We found that  the ER-localised ubiquitin ligase Hrd1/SYVN1 mediates ER-associated degradation  (ERAD) of PMP22(L16P) and PMP22(G150D), and another ubiquitin ligase, gp78/AMFR, mediates ERAD of PMP22(G150D) as well.

What is the aim of iodine prophylaxis?,"Iodine prophylaxis aims to reduce the risk for radiogenic thyroid cancer by a factor of three in children, particularly those under 18 years, by administering potassium iodide (KI) to block the intake of radioactive iodine isotopes."," Context: A potential radiation protection method to reduce the risk of adverse health  outcomes in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release is the  administration of potassium iodide (KI). Although KI administration is  recommended by WHO's Guidelines for Iodine Prophylaxis following Nuclear  Accidents, a systematic review of the scientific evidence for the guidelines is  lacking. Therefore, this study aims to systematically review the effects of KI administration in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release on thyroid  cancer, hypothyroidism and benign thyroid nodules. We applied standard  systematic review methodology for a search of the literature, selection of eligible studies, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, assessment of  heterogeneity, data synthesis, and the assessment of the quality of the  evidence. We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) and EMBASE. We found one  ,  Context: a factor of three. For children, the WHO has therefore recommended a 10 mGy  avertable dose to the thyroid. The Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority  acknowledge the WHO guidelines and advise that the first priority of all  emergency preparedness planning for potential releases that can cause dispersion  of radioactive iodine, should be given to the protection of pregnant and  breast-feeding women, newborns and children under 18 years. Iodine tablets  should be taken immediately (preferably not later than a few hours) in  situations where inhalation of radioactive iodine may occur. It should be  underlined that iodine prophylaxis is one of several emergency countermeasures; other measures are sheltering and evacuation. The latter two countermeasures  will protect not only from intake of radioactive iodine, but also against other  radionuclides that may be released. Based on the present risk assessment in Norway, iodine tablets have been distributed to the counties north of Salten. In  addition, there is an emergency stockpile of iodine tablets in Oslo.  ,  Context: Radioactive iodine isotopes may be released to air to a varying degree during  accidents with nuclear reactors.

What is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4?,I am uncertain about what is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4.," Context: patients exhibited CD characterized by abnormal ciliary motion and nNO levels  below or near the PCD cutoff values. Patients with CD aged >6 years show  increased respiratory symptoms similar to those seen in PCD. Sequencing of all  14 known PCD genes in 13 heterotaxy patients with CD, 12 without CD, 10 PCD  disease controls, and 13 healthy controls yielded 0.769, 0.417, 1.0, and 0.077  novel variants per patient, respectively. One heterotaxy patient with CD had the  PCD causing DNAI1 founder mutation. Another with hyperkinetic ciliary beat had 2  mutations in DNAH11, the only PCD gene known to cause hyperkinetic beat. Among  PCD patients, 2 had known PCD causing CCDC39 and CCDC40 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies show that CHD patients with heterotaxy have substantial  risk for CD and increased respiratory disease. Heterotaxy patients with CD were  enriched for mutations in PCD genes. Future studies are needed to assess the potential benefit of prescreening and prophylactically treating heterotaxy  patients for CD.  ,  Context: centres, is challenging because recent studies have expanded the spectrum of  HVMA findings in PCD from grossly abnormal to very subtle. The objective of this  study was to describe the diversity of HVMA findings in genetically confirmed  PCD individuals. HVMA was performed as part of the routine work-up of  individuals with suspected PCD. Subsequent molecular analysis identified  biallelic mutations in the PCD-related genes of 66 individuals. 1072 videos of  these subjects were assessed for correlation with the genotype. Biallelic  mutations (19 novel) were found in 17 genes: DNAI1, DNAI2, DNAH5, DNAH11,  CCDC103, ARMC4, KTU/DNAAF2, LRRC50/DNAAF1, LRRC6, DYX1C1, ZMYND10, CCDC39, CCDC40, CCDC164, HYDIN, RSPH4A and RSPH1. Ciliary beat pattern variations  correlated well with the genetic findings, allowing the classification of  typical HVMA findings for different genetic groups. In contrast, analysis of ciliary beat frequency did not result in additional diagnostic impact. In  conclusion, this study provides detailed knowledge about the diversity of HVMA  findings in PCD and may therefore be seen as a guide to the improvement of PCD  diagnostics.  ,  Context: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder leading to recurrent  respiratory tract infections.

Between 2006  and 2017, we evaluated six patients with a clinical diagnosis of TAS, based on  the presence of at least two symptoms, usually adrenal insufficiency and  alacrima. In all cases, genetic analysis revealed homozygous mutations in the  AAAS gene. One novel mutation was detected: a homozygous 10-bp deletion  (c.1264_1273del, p.Q422NfsX126) in exon 14 of the AAAS gene that caused a  frameshift that introduced an aberrant stop codon after 126 amino acids. This  genetic variant is likely to be pathogenic because it caused a significant change in protein structure. A precise genotype-phenotype correlation was  impossible to establish. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our experience, we recommend that molecular analysis should be performed in the presence of alacrima and at least one more symptom of  TAS. Our cases share many clinical features of TAS and underline the variability  in this syndrome, as well as the need for thorough investigation following a  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Dravet syndrome is a severe form of epilepsy. Majority of patients  have a mutation in SCN1A gene, which encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel. A  recent study has demonstrated that 16% of SCN1A-negative patients have a  mutation in PCDH19, the gene encoding protocadherin-19. Mutations in other genes  account for only a very small proportion of families. TSPYL4 is a novel  candidate gene within the locus 6q16.3-q22.31 identified by linkage study. OBJECTIVE: The present study examined the mutations in epileptic Chinese  children with emphasis on Dravet syndrome. METHODS: A hundred children with severe epilepsy were divided into Dravet syndrome and non-Dravet syndrome groups and screened for SCN1A mutations by  direct sequencing. SCN1A-negative Dravet syndrome patients and patients with  phenotypes resembling Dravet syndrome were checked for PCDH19 and TSPYL4  mutations.

Although TORC1 signaling is  repressed by various stresses in yeast, the underlying mechanisms remain  elusive. Here we report that TORC1 signaling upon heat stress is regulated by  stress granules (SGs), which are cytoplasmic foci formed under certain stresses.  Ectopic formation of SGs achieved by Pbp1 overexpression in unstressed cells sequesters TORC1 in this compartment, thereby blunting TORC1 signaling. Upon  heat stress, a physiological SG-inducing condition, TORC1 is also recruited to  SGs, which delays reactivation of TORC1 signaling during recovery from heat stress. Moreover, TORC1 reactivation is directed through SG disassembly,  suggesting that SGs act as a key determinant for TORC1 reactivation during  recovery from heat stress.

Accordingly, cross-linking of TFIIB to the 3' end of genes was abolished in the  mutants of Pap1, Rna14, and Pcf11. We further show that in sua7-1 cells, where  holo-TFIIB complex is not formed, the kinetics of activated transcription is  altered. These results suggest that a complex of TFIIB, CF1 subunits, and Pap1  exists in yeast cells. Furthermore, TFIIB interaction with the CF1 complex and  Pap1 is crucial for gene looping and transcriptional regulation.  ,  Context:  Poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) has a fundamental role in the regulation of  mRNA translation and stability, both of which are crucial for a wide variety of  cellular processes.

PABPs are primarily cytosolic with the exception of the  nuclear PABP (PABPN1), which is located in the nucleus. Within the nucleus,  PABPN1 is believed to bind to the poly(A) tail of nascent mRNA and along with  cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) define the length of the  newly synthesized poly(A) tail.  METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The cellular role of PABP1 has been extensively  studied over the years; however, the function of other PABPs remains poorly  defined. In order to understand the role of PABPN1 in cellular mRNA metabolism and it's interrelation with other PABPs, we depleted PABPN1 using RNAi in HeLa  and HEK293 cells. Our results show that PABPN1 depletion did not have any effect  on the poly(A) tail length, nuclear export of mRNA, mRNA translation, and transcription. Rather, PABPN1 depletion resulted in a compensatory response as  observed by increased level of PABP5 and nuclear accumulation of PABP4. In  addition, PABP4 was associated with the poly(A) tract of pre-mRNA and CPSF in  ","20174964, 20174964, 21835917, 21940797, 21940797, 23300856","Poly(A)polymerase-alpha (PAPOLA) has been the most extensively investigated mammalian polyadenylating enzyme, mainly in regard to its multifaceted post-translational regulation.

The crystal was trigonal, belonging to space group  ,  Context:  Budding yeast mating is an excellent model for receptor-activated cell  differentiation. Here we identify the related transcription factors Ecm22 and  Upc2 as novel regulators of mating. Cells lacking both ECM22 and UPC2 display strong mating defects whereas deletion of either gene has no effect. Ecm22 and  Upc2 positively regulate basal expression of PRM1 and PRM4. These genes are  strongly induced in response to mating pheromone, which is also largely dependent on ECM22 and UPC2. We further show that deletion of PRM4 like PRM1  results in markedly reduced mating efficiency. Expression of PRM1 but not of  PRM4 is also regulated by Ste12, a key transcription factor for mating.

What is the origin of  HEp-2 cells?,"Unfortunately, I am uncertain about the origin of HEp-2 cells as it is not explicitly stated in the provided context."," Context: purities and identities of the CAFs and NFs. Although the CAFs manifested higher  migration, invasion, proliferation, and cancer-promoting capacities compared  with the NFs, an analysis of chromosomes revealed that both the CAFs and NFs  showed typical normal mouse karyotypes. In addition, the NFs co-cultured with  HEp-2 cells did not show induced expressions of activated markers of CAFs. Our  findings reveal that the CAFs in the HEp-2 established laryngeal xenografted  tumor are not of laryngeal cancer origin but of mouse origin, indicating that  the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells cannot generate their own CAFs via EMT in this  model.  ,  Context: The association of anti-nuclear antigen (ANA) and anti-cardiolipin (CL)  antibodies is often observed during systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or the  primary anti-phospholipid syndrome, thereby raising the possibility of a  relationship between these two autoantibody populations. To determine whether  ANA and anti-CL antibodies can overlap, we derived, from a male (NZW x BXSB)F1  mouse, 14 hybridomas selected based on their capacities to react with CL and to  label HEp-2 cell nuclei. Four of these anti-CL were IgG and bound to CL and  phosphatidylserine in a cofactor-dependent manner and reacted strongly with  nucleosomes. Variable region sequence analysis indicated that these four monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were derived from three independent B cell clones  that used recurrent heavy and/or light chain immunoglobulin rearrangements, as  assessed by comparison with each other and prototypic anti-CL mAb previously derived from different lupus mouse strains. These results indicate that anti-CL  mAb can have overlapping cross-reactivities with nucleosomes, thereby defining a  new category of SLE-related autoantibodies characterized by their capacities to  ,  Context: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a crucial role in cancer progression  and even initiation. However, the origins of CAFs in various cancer types remain  controversial, and one of the important hypothesized origins is through  epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) from cancer cells. In this study, we  investigated whether the HEp-2 laryngeal cancer cells are able to generate CAFs  via EMT during tumor formation, which is now still unknown. The laryngeal  xenografted tumor model was established by inoculating the HEp-2 laryngeal  cancer cell line in nude mice. Primary cultured CAFs from the tumor nodules and  matched normal fibroblasts (NFs) from the adjacent connective tissues were subcultured, purified, and verified by immunofluorescence. Migration, invasion,  and proliferation potentials were compared between the CAFs and NFs. A  co-culture of CAFs with HEp-2 cells and a co-injection of CAFs with HEp-2 cells in nude mice were performed to examine the cancer-promoting potential of CAFs to  further verify their identity.

Epidemiological reports have  suggested that malarial infection transiently enhances HIV-1 replication and  increases HIV-1 viral load in co-infected individuals. Because this viremia  stays high for several weeks after treatment with antimalarials, this phenomenon  could have an impact on disease progression and transmission. The cellular  immunological mechanisms behind these observations have been studied only  scarcely. The few in vitro studies investigating the impact of malaria on HIV-1 have demonstrated that exposure to soluble malarial antigens can increase HIV-1  infection and reactivation in immune cells. However, these studies used whole  cell extracts of P. falciparum schizont stage parasites and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), making it hard to decipher which malarial component(s)  was responsible for the observed effects and what the target host cells were.  Recent work has demonstrated that exposure of immature monocyte-derived  ,  Context: Program, University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla,  California 92093, USA.

MATERIALS & METHODS: 56 patients with reduced CBH received 63 implants in the  posterior maxilla. All implants intentionally penetrated the Schneiderian  membrane and engaged the sinus floor cortical bone. All patients were followed  up and implant survival was assessed at the end of one year post implant  restoration. RESULTS: Out of 63 implants, there was only one failure (98.4% Survival rate)  after a follow up period of one year. 7 patients experienced mild epistaxis during the immediate post-operative period with no associated implant loss.

The majority of patients assessed  had an elevation of their INR following concomitant use of warfarin and  corticosteroids. The INR change was observed at a mean +/- SD of 6.7 +/- 3.3  days following the first dose of corticosteroid. Overall, 16 patients (50%)  required a modification of their anticoagulation therapy during or following  corticosteroid therapy. Only one adverse event of minor epistaxis was reported, and no ED visits or hospitalizations occurred as a consequence of the drug  combination.

OBJECTIVE: To provide information on the efficacy of non-hormonal therapies for  menopausal vasomotor symptoms based on evidence from published randomised  controlled studies. METHODS: The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), MEDLINE, Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine database (ATHMD) and Allied and  Complementary Medicine database (AMED) were searched for randomised controlled  trials in the English language reporting data on treatment of menopausal  ,  Context: chronic disease or, indeed, psychological and social stressors. The mechanisms  leading to frailty typically involve several systems: mainly hormones, oxidative  stress, inflammation, immunity, and vascular system. One of the most outstanding  pillars of the frailty syndrome is the loss of muscle quantity and function,  referred to as sarcopenia. The main bulk of experimental pharmacological  interventions addressing the clinical problem of frailty have been focused on  the use of hormones, as replacement therapy in subjects with low or normal  circulating basal levels of the hormone. Results have been disappointing, except  for the case of testosterone that have shown some benefits. The effectiveness of other potential therapeutic interventions (antioxidants, anti-inflammatory  agents, nutritional supplements) appears to be limited or has not been explored  in detail until now. In conclusion, there is an available path to prevent the development of disability in older people through the treatment of frailty, its  main risk factor. Aditional research and further experimental testing will help  to identify new targets and help to make this journey successful.  ,  Context: is 40% or less and is accompanied by progressive left ventricular dilatation and  adverse cardiac remodeling.

BBCAnalyzer is able to visualize base counts at predefined positions or regions in any sequence alignment data that are available as BAM files. Thereby, the tool provides a straightforward solution for evaluating any list of expected mutations like hotspot mutations, or even whole regions of interest. In addition to an ordinary textual report, BBCAnalyzer reports highly customizable plots. Information on the counted number of bases, the reference bases, known mutations or polymorphisms, called mutations and base qualities is summarized in a single plot. By uniting this information in a graphical way, the user may easily decide on a variant being present or not - completely independent of any internal filters or frequency thresholds.",28241736

It is therefore plausible that with an increasing number of drugs  the risk of drug interactions increases. Such interactions can be either  pharmacodynamic (and are due to the mechanism of the administered drugs) or they  can be pharmacokinetic (resulting in a reduction or enhancement of drug  elimination). Pharmacokinetic interactions can be either due to interactions at  the level of drug metabolizing enzymes (most important cytochrome P450 (CYP)  enzymes) or interactions at the level of drug transporter proteins (for example  P-glycoprotein (MDR1)). It is important to distinguish between both mechanisms because interactions at transporter proteins can be attributed to those drugs  that are not enzymatically metabolized. The scope of this article is to give an  overview on clinically relevant interactions of the four beta-blockers widely used in the therapy of cardiovascular diseases namely atenolol (CAS 29122-68-7),  bisoprolol (CAS 66722-44-9), metoprolol (CAS 37350-58-6) (each beta-1  selective), and carvedilol (CAS 72956-09-3) (beta-1 and beta-2 nonselective).  ,  Context: The use of medicinal plants concomitantly with conventional drugs can result in  herb-drug interactions that cause fluctuations in drug bioavailability and  consequent therapeutic failure and/or toxic effects. The CYP superfamily of  enzymes plays an important role in herb-drug interactions. Among CYP enzymes,  CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are the most relevant since they metabolize about 50% and 30%  of the drugs on the market, respectively. Thus, the main goal of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of in vitro interactions between medicinal plant  extracts and drug substrates of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes.

Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"HuR binds to and stabilizes the mRNA for Mdm2, a critical negative regulator of p53, thereby keeping p53 levels in check in progenitor cells."," Context:  HuR, also known as Elavl1, is an RNA-binding protein that regulates embryonic  development, progenitor cell survival, and cell stress responses. The role of  HuR in angiogenesis is not known. Using a myeloid-specific HuR knock-out mouse model (Elavl1Mø KO), we show that HuR expression in bone marrow-derived  macrophages (BMDMs) is needed to maintain the expression of genes enriched in  AU-rich elements and U-rich elements in the 3'-UTR. In addition, BMDMs from Elavl1Mø KO mice also showed alterations in expression of several miRNAs.

Expression levels are dynamic, varying between tissues and  developmental stages. However, a strong positive correlation between AUF1 and  HuR protein levels was observed in all examined tissues. Finally, we compared  AUF1 and HuR expression with accumulation of one common target mRNA, c-myc. The  similar spatio-temporal distribution of these proteins and of c-myc mRNA is in agreement with a potential concerted role in ARE-mediated control of mRNA  stability.  ,  Context: The RNA-binding protein HuR (also known as ELAV1) binds to the 3'-untranslated  region of mRNAs and regulates transcript stability and translation.

HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs).

Although  the search for underlying patterns encoded in nucleosomal DNA has been going on for about 30 years, our knowledge of these patterns still remains limited. Based  on our evaluations of DNA deformation energy, we developed new scoring functions  to predict nucleosome positioning. There are three principal differences between our approach and earlier studies: (i) we assume that the length of nucleosomal  DNA varies from 146 to 147 bp; (ii) we consider the anisotropic flexibility of  pyrimidine-purine (YR) dimeric steps in the context of their neighbors (e.g.,  ,  Context: Eukaryotic genomes are packed into chromatin, whose basic repeating unit is the  nucleosome. Nucleosome positioning is a widely researched area. A common  experimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of  micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase  in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the  resulting fragments. This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and  especially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. As a  consequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major  determinant of nucleosome positioning in vivo. More generally, our results show that data generated after MNase digestion of chromatin requires a matched  control experiment in order to determine nucleosome positions.  ,  Context:  MOTIVATION: The intrinsic DNA sequence is an important determinant of nucleosome  positioning. Some DNA sequence patterns can facilitate nucleosome formation,  while others can inhibit nucleosome formation. Nucleosome positioning influences the overall rate of sequence evolution. However, its impacts on specific  patterns of sequence evolution are still poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, we examined whether nucleosomal DNA and nucleosome-depleted DNA show distinct polymorphism patterns to maintain adequate nucleosome architecture  on a genome scale in yeast. We found that sequence polymorphisms in nucleosomal  DNA tend to facilitate nucleosome formation, whereas polymorphisms in  ,  Context: The fundamental repeating unit of eukaryotic chromatin is the nucleosome.  Besides being involved in packaging DNA, nucleosome organization plays an  important role in transcriptional regulation and cellular identity. Currently,  there is much debate about the major determinants of the nucleosome architecture  of a genome and its significance with little being known about its role in stem  cells. To address these questions, we performed ultra-deep sequencing of  nucleosomal DNA in two human embryonic stem cell lines and integrated our data  with numerous epigenomic maps. Our analyses have revealed that the genome is a  determinant of nucleosome organization with transcriptionally inactive regions characterized by a ""ground state"" of nucleosome profiles driven by underlying  DNA sequences. DNA sequence preferences are associated with heterogeneous  chromatin organization around transcription start sites. Transcription, histone modifications, and DNA methylation alter this ""ground state"" by having distinct  effects on both nucleosome positioning and occupancy. As the transcriptional  rate increases, nucleosomes become better positioned. Exons transcribed and  ,  Context: A major question in chromatin biology is to what extent the sequence of DNA  directly determines the genetic and chromatin organization of a eukaryotic  genome? We consider two aspects to this question: the DNA sequence-specified  positioning of nucleosomes and the determination of NDRs (nucleosome-depleted  regions) or barriers. We argue that, in budding yeast, while DNA  sequence-specified nucleosome positioning may contribute to positions flanking  the regions lacking nucleosomes, DNA thermodynamic stability is a major  component determinant of the genetic organization of this organism.  ,  Context:  A major question in chromatin biology is to what extent the sequence of DNA  directly determines the genetic and chromatin organization of a eukaryotic  genome?

Are there any desmins present in plants?,"No, desmin is specifically mentioned as a muscle-specific intermediate filament, with no mention of its presence in plants."," Context: but pellets contained long filaments (greater than 1 micron) with an average  diameter of 10 nm. As the temperature increased, both the average diameter and  average length of particles in the supernatant increased. Thermodynamic analysis  indicated that hydrophobic interactions were dominant during desmin assembly,  but that ionic interactions might also be involved. Our results demonstrated  that the specific cation and temperature and temperature-cation interactions all  are important in assembly of desmin intermediate filaments.  ,  Context:  Desmin, the muscle-specific intermediate filament, is involved in myofibrillar  myopathies, dilated cardiomyopathy and muscle wasting.

In this review, we summarize the  findings on desmin PTMs and their implication in biological processes and pathologies, and discuss the current knowledge on the regulation of the desmin  network by PTMs. We conclude that the desmin filament network can be seen as an  intricate scaffold for muscle cell structure and biological processes and that its dynamics can be affected by PTMs. There are now precise tools to investigate  PTMs and visualize cellular structures that have been underexploited in the  study of desminopathies.

Which algorithm is available for computing minimal absent words using external memory?,emMAW," Context: genomes.

It  has been noted that longer absent words might also be of interest, but the  existing algorithms only provide generic absent words by trivially extending the  shortest ones. RESULTS: We show how absent words relate to the repetitions and structure of the  data, and define a new and larger class of absent words, called minimal absent  words, that still captures the essential properties of the shortest absent words  introduced in recent works. The words of this new class are minimal in the sense that if their leftmost or rightmost character is removed, then the resulting  word is no longer an absent word. We describe an algorithm for generating  minimal absent words that, in practice, runs in approximately linear time. An implementation of this algorithm is publicly available at  ftp://www.ieeta.pt/~ap/maws. CONCLUSION: Because the set of minimal absent words that we propose is much  larger than the set of the shortest absent words, it is potentially more useful  ","28407038, 28407038, 25526884, 28407038, 28407038, 19426495",emMAW,28407038

Cholera, a potentially life-threatening  bacterial infection that occurs in the intestines and causes severe diarrhea and dehydration, has a low incidence in the U.S., but a high incidence in Africa,  Southeast Asia, and other locations around the world. These areas draw travelers  from the U.S., so cholera can present in patients who return from visits to these regions. Previous means of prophylaxis included the use of doxycycline for  the prevention of traveler's diarrhea, but doxycycline is not specific for  cholera. With the approval of Vaxchora, a live attenuated, single-dose, oral  ,  Context: DATA SOURCES: A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE (1946 to January  week 3, 2017) and EMBASE (1996 to 2017 week 3).

In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial.  Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous  lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes  SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted  TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic  cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each  cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome  inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously.

What is the mechanism of action of abiraterone?,"Abiraterone acts by inhibiting the enzyme cytochrome P450 17 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP17), which is involved in androgen production. Additionally, it also acts as an antagonist to the androgen receptor and"," Context: as castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which continues to be a challenge  to treat. Addition of androgen antagonists to hormonal deprivation has been  successful in lowering the prostate-specific antigen levels further, but has not  actually translated into life-prolonging options. The results of several  contemporary studies have continued to demonstrate activation of the androgen  receptor as being the key factor in the continued growth of prostate cancer.  Blockade of androgen production by nongonadal sources has led to clinical  benefit in this setting. One such agent is abiraterone acetate, which  significantly reduces androgen production by blocking the enzyme, cytochrome P450 17 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP17). This has provided physicians with another  treatment option for patients with CRPC. The landscape for prostate cancer  treatment has changed with the approval of cabazitaxel, sipuleucel-T and abiraterone. Here we provide an overview of abiraterone acetate, its mechanism  of action, and its potential place for therapy in CRPC.  ,  Context: production of intratumoral androgens are necessary. The introduction of  abiraterone, a potent suppressor of cytochrome P450 17 α-hydroxysteroid  dehydrogenase-mediated androgen production, has heralded a new era in the  hormonal treatment of men with metastatic CRPC.

Furthermore, the clinical success of abiraterone demonstrated  that CRPC, which has previously been regarded as an androgen-independent  disease, is still driven, at least in part, by androgens. More importantly,  abiraterone is a 'promiscuous' drug that interacts with a number of targets,  which dictate its clinical benefits and adverse effects profile. Besides CYP17 inhibition, abiraterone acts as an antagonist to the androgen receptor and  inhibits 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase--two effects that potentially  contribute to its antitumour effects. However, the inhibition of the 17α-hydroxylase activity of CYP17, CYP11B1 and a panel of hepatic CYP enzymes  leads to adverse effects and toxicities that include secondary mineralocorticoid  excess.

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,"Thyroid hormone stimulates hepatic glucose production via a sympathetic pathway, and rodent studies suggest that similar neural routes exist for thyroid hormone analogues (e.g. thyronamines). Further elucidation of central effects of thyroid hormone on autonomic out"," Context: release by rat liver mitochondria. Hypothyroid animals were used because of the  low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to  reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The  observed changes could be explained by a partial block, operated by  thyronamines, at a site located near the site of action of antimycin A. This  hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that thyronamines reduced the  activity of Complex III where the site of antimycin action is located. Because  thyronamines exerted their effects at concentrations comparable to those found  in hepatic tissue, it is conceivable that they can affect in vivo mitochondrial O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2) production acting as modulators of thyroid hormone  action.  ,  Context: widely used to manage severe thyrotoxicosis. Recent experiments show that the  effects of thyrotoxicosis on hepatic glucose production and insulin sensitivity  can be modulated by selective hepatic sympathetic and parasympathetic  denervation. Indeed, thyroid hormone stimulates hepatic glucose production via a  sympathetic pathway, a novel central pathway for thyroid hormone action. Rodent  studies suggest that similar neural routes exist for thyroid hormone analogues  (e.g. thyronamines). Further elucidation of central effects of thyroid hormone  on autonomic outflow to metabolic organs, including the thyroid and brown  adipose tissue, will add to our understanding of hyperthyroidism.  ,  Context:  A class of thyroid hormone metabolites has dramatic physiological effects on  metabolism and heart rate by still-unknown mechanisms of action. A recent study  has discovered that thyronamines can inhibit neuronal reuptake of neurotransmitters and prevent the intracellular transport of monoamines for  release. This discovery presents a third signaling pathway for thyroid hormone,  expands the role that thyroid plays in the central nervous system, and suggests mechanisms of action for the effects of thyronamine-derived neuromodulators.  ,  Context: Sulfotransferases (SULTs) catalyze the sulfation of many endogenous compounds  that include monoamine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine (DA), and thyroid  hormones (iodothyronines). Decarboxylation of iodothyronines results in  formation of thyronamines. In the mouse, thyronamines act rapidly in a  nongenomic fashion to initiate hypothermia and decrease cardiac output and heart  rate. These effects are attenuated after 1-4 h, and metabolism of thyronamines via sulfation may be a mechanism for termination of thyronamine action. We  carried out this study to test thyronamine (T0AM), 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM),  3,5-diiodothyronamine (T2AM), and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronamine (T3AM) as substrates for human liver and cDNA-expressed SULT activities. We characterized several  biochemical properties of SULTs using the thyronamines that acted as substrates  for SULT activities in a human liver high-speed supernatant pool (n=3). T1AM led  ,  Context: Thyronamines are naturally occurring, chemical relatives of thyroid hormone.  Systemic administration of synthetic 3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM) and - to a  lesser extent - thyronamine (T(0)AM), leads to acute bradycardia, hypothermia,  decreased metabolic rate, and hyperglycemia. This profile led us to hypothesize  that the central nervous system is among the principal targets of thyronamines.  We investigated whether a low dose i.c.v. infusion of synthetic thyronamines recapitulates the changes in glucose metabolism that occur following i.p.  thyronamine administration. Plasma glucose, glucoregulatory hormones, and  endogenous glucose production (EGP) using stable isotope dilution were monitored in rats before and 120 min after an i.p. (50 mg/kg) or i.c.v. (0.5 mg/kg) bolus  infusion of T(1)AM, T(0)AM, or vehicle. To identify the peripheral effects of  centrally administered thyronamines, drug-naive rats were also infused  ,  Context: 100-fold lower dose administered centrally induced a more pronounced acute EGP  increase and hyperglucagonemia while plasma insulin tended to decrease. Both  systemic and central infusions of T(0)AM caused smaller increases in EGP, plasma  glucose, and glucagon compared with T(1)AM. Neither T(1)AM nor T(0)AM influenced  any of these parameters upon low dose i.v. administration. We conclude that  central administration of low-dose thyronamines suffices to induce the acute  alterations in glucoregulatory hormones and glucose metabolism following  systemic thyronamine infusion. Our data indicate that thyronamines can act  centrally to modulate glucose metabolism.

What is known about prostate cancer screening in the UK ?,"There is no national screening programme for prostate cancer in the UK.

However, the Department of Health guidelines are not widely followed, and"," Context:  BACKGROUND: Worldwide, the use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing as a  screen for prostate cancer is contentious. Whilst there is no National UK  Screening programme, many men undergo opportunistic screening. This study investigates UK urologist's usage of PSA and the awareness surrounding the  Department of Health (DoH) PSA guidelines. METHODS: Urologists were sent a questionnaire regarding PSA cut-off values. RESULTS: Of the 733 urologists eligible to participate in this study 346  returned completed questionnaires giving a response rate of 47%. The most  commonly generally used age-related PSA cut-off values (36% of respondents)  ,  Context: Kingdom, and prevention and screening is no exception to this general rule. The  assessment of screening is now implemented through the National Screening  Committee, established in 1997. The three issues reviewed in this paper have all  been assessed within the context of the Department of Health. In the case of  mammography, the assessment was done more than 10 years ago and was followed by  a rational implementation of a national screening program for breast cancer. In  the case of prostate cancer screening, two systematic reviews have concluded  that screening should not be carried out. In general, this recommendation has  been accepted in the United Kingdom. Use of ultrasound in pregnancy has been assessed by the National Screening Committee. This complex technology is  difficult to assess, and the screening procedure is deeply embedded in clinical  practice in the United Kingdom, so assessment has not had much impact on the frequency of screening.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"Mediator regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to promoters, and high Mediator binding density defines super enhancers that regulate cell-identity genes and oncogenes."," Context:  CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a master organizer of genome spatial organization  and plays an important role in mediating extensive chromatin interactions.  Circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) is a high-throughput approach that allows genome-wide screening for unknown potential interaction partners. Using a  conserved CTCF binding site on the Bcl11b locus as bait, an interaction partner  at the Arhgap6 locus on a different chromosome was identified by 4C. Additional experiments verified that the interchromatin interaction between the Bcl11b and  Arhgap6 loci was cell-type specific, which was cooperatively mediated by CTCF  and cohesin. Functional analysis showed that the interchromatin interaction  ,  Context: The organization of chromatin within the nucleus and the regulation of  transcription are tightly linked. Recently, mechanisms underlying this  relationship have been uncovered. By defining the organizational hierarchy of  the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with  changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the  context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and  transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin,  CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein  genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity. As such, chromatin organization plays a central role in establishing and  maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome  organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Gene expression is mediated by specialized cis-regulatory modules  (CRMs), the most prominent of which are called enhancers. Early experiments  indicated that enhancers located far from the gene promoters are often  responsible for mediating gene transcription. Knowing their properties,  regulatory activity, and genomic targets is crucial to the functional  understanding of cellular events, ranging from cellular homeostasis to differentiation. Recent genome-wide investigation of epigenomic marks has  indicated that enhancer elements could be enriched for certain epigenomic marks,  such as, combinatorial patterns of histone modifications. METHODS: Our efforts in this paper are motivated by these recent advances in  epigenomic profiling methods, which have uncovered enhancer-associated chromatin  features in different cell types and organisms. Specifically, in this paper, we  ,  Context: the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with  changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the  context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and  transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin,  CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein  genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity.

Such resistance mechanisms often  arise due to altered gene regulation following detection of antimicrobials/cell  wall damage by sensory proteins at the membrane. This facilitates alterations to  the cell wall or changes in the composition of the membrane. Other general forms  of resistance include the formation of spores or biofilms, which are a common  mechanistic response to many classes of antimicrobials. In rare cases, bacteria  have been shown to possess specific antilantibiotic mechanisms. These are often species specific and include the nisin lytic protein nisinase and the phenomenon  of immune mimicry.  ,  Context: Acquired Bartter-like syndrome (BLS), characterized by hypokalemic metabolic  alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and normal kidney function, can be  induced by diuretics or antibiotics.
