What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,The implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma is that it is significantly involved in tumor establishment and progression.," Context: Histone modification plays important roles in many biological processes such as  development and carcinogenesis. Methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) is  commonly associated with transcriptional activation of genes. H3K4 methylation ,  Context: many studies indicating that they are significantly involved in tumor  establishment and progression. Histone methyltransferases (HMTs) are a large  group of enzymes that specifically methylate protein lysine and arginine ,  Context: many studies indicating that they are significantly involved in tumor  establishment and progression. Histone methyltransferases (HMTs) are a large  group of enzymes that specifically methylate protein lysine and arginine ,  Context: genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in ","25706881, 23557020, 23557020, 19270706","Aberrant patterns of H3K4, H3K9, and H3K27 histone lysine methylation were shown to result in histone code alterations, which induce changes in gene expression, and affect the proliferation rate of cells in medulloblastoma.","23179372, 19270706, 23184418"
