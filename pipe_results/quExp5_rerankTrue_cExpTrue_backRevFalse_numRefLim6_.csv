What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Histone lysine methylation, particularly at H3K9, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma. Defective control of the histone code contributes to the disease, and restoration of expression of genes controlling H"," Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,  ,  Context: remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  (EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in  medulloblastoma. Our data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation  affects only a subset of genes, and does not support the existence of a  concordant methylation phenotype in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic  TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify  RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the  requirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the  tumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation.  ,  Context: We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and  loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.  We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal  genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9). Post-translational modification of histone  proteins is critical for regulation of gene expression, can participate in determination of stem cell fates and has been implicated in carcinogenesis.  Consistent with our genetic data, restoration of expression of genes controlling  H3K9 methylation greatly diminishes proliferation of medulloblastoma in vitro.

Regardless of the tested fish species, PC and PE are the dominant  phospholipid classes, followed by PI and PS. Furthermore, principal component  analysis (PCA) was applied to normalize the relative amounts of the identified  phospholipid species. The results demonstrate that PS 18:0/22:6, PI 18:0/20:4,  and PI 18:0/20:5 were the main contributors of cumulative value and could be  used as an indicator for fish species differentiation. This shotgun lipidomics  method was >10 times faster than traditional methods, because no chromatographic  separation was needed. The successful application of this strategy paves the way for full utilization of traditionally discarded fisheries wastes and provides an  alternative means for fish species differentiation.  ,  Context: diagnosed with SDB.

At all AHI cutoffs, the AUC ranged from 0.688 to 0.715 for the NoSAS score and  from 0.663 to 0.693 for the STOP-Bang questionnaire. The NoSAS score had the  largest AUC (0.715, 95% CI: 0.655-0.775) of diagnosing SDB at AHI cutoff of ≥5  events/h. NoSAS performed better in discriminating moderate-to-severe SDB than  STOP-Bang with a marginally significantly higher AUC (0.697 vs. 0.663, P=0.046).

The patients were  followed up until patient death, graft loss, or December 2009 (mean follow-up: 3  ± 2.8 years). The linear mixed effect model for longitudinal repeated measures  was applied. To compare MS versus its components we used the Akaike information  Criterion (AIC) to determine the best model according to the Anderson and  Burnham method. RESULTS: Univariate and multivariate analyses models using MS were more efficient than those using the individual components, which consisted of waist  circumference, low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia,  hyperglycemia, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The AIC was the lowest with MS models indicating better prediction on graft function than the  individual components.

Synucleinopathy lesions spread to larger brain areas as the disease progresses, and prion-like cell-to-cell transmission of  aggregated α-synuclein is thought to be the underlying mechanism for this  pathological spreading. LRRK2 is another protein linked to the pathogenesis of PD, and its presence in Lewy bodies has attracted much attention as to whether  LRRK2 and α-synuclein interplay during the pathogenesis of PD. However, the  relationship between these two crucial proteins still remains unclear. In this  ,  Context: Lewy bodies are intraneuronal inclusions initially found in the pigmented  brainstem nuclei of patients with Parkinson's disease. Their aspect varies  according to their neuronal or cerebral situation. They have been a long time  the hallmark of Parkinson's disease, but in recent years it has emerged that a  small group of rare disorders or rare variants of common degenerative diseases  are also sometimes associated with Lewy bodies in the nervous system.  Pathological studies have also individualized a new disorder characterized by  the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the  brainstem: Lewy body disease. The clinical syndrome associates dementia, parkinsonian features, dysautonomia and motor neuron disease. The dementia is  cortical in type and psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations or  delusions are frequent. The pathological features are nerve cell loss, diffuse Lewy bodies, and sometimes senile plaques. The origin of this disorder remains  unclear, but it could be a primitive abnormality of neuronal cytoskeleton.  ,  Context: Lewy bodies are intraneuronal inclusions initially found in the pigmented  brainstem nuclei of patients with Parkinson's disease.

The pathological features are nerve cell loss, diffuse Lewy bodies, and sometimes senile plaques. The origin of this disorder remains  unclear, but it could be a primitive abnormality of neuronal cytoskeleton.  ,  Context: Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies are very frequent neurological  disorders of the elderly. Mutations in the alpha-synuclein (alphaSYN) gene cause  Parkinson's disease, often associated with dementia. Neuropathologically these  diseases are characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites,  intraneuronal inclusions mostly composed of alphaSYN protein fibrils. Moreover,  alphaSYN is phosphorylated at S129 (phospho-serine-129 [PSer129]) in neuropathological lesions. Using our (Thy1)-[A30P]alphaSYN transgenic mouse  model that develops age-dependent impairment in fear conditioning behavior, we  investigated PSer129 immunostaining in the brain. We found distinct staining patterns using new, sensitive monoclonal antibodies. Somal and nuclear PSer129  immunoreactivity increased with age in hippocampal and cortical areas as well as  the lateral/basolateral amygdalar nuclei and was present also in young,  ,  Context: Autonomic failure with Lewy bodies (AF-LB) was first described by Fichefet et  al. in 1965, and more than ten cases have been reported to date. AF-LB and  Parkinson's disease (PD) share the neuropathological findings characterized by  widely distributed Lewy bodies in the central nervous system including the  substantia nigra and locus coeruleus. However, clinical manifestations of AF-LB  are far different from PD in which autonomic dysfunction, if present, is not a predominant feature. In the present study, clinical features were comparatively  analysed in AF-LB and PD to investigate the nosological relation between PD and  AF-LB. The subjects were 94 patients with PD and 11 reported cases of AF-LB in the literature. A test of 70 degrees passive head-up tilt was performed upon the  patients with PD in our laboratory. Based on the results in tilting test, the  patients with PD were divided into two groups; PD-I (69 cases) with an  ,  Context:  Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), the second most frequent cause of dementia  after Alzheimer disease (AD), is characterized by the widespread distribution of  Lewy bodies in virtually every brain area. Clinically, DLB is distinguished from AD by fluctuating cognition, prominent visual hallucinations and parkinsonism,  and from Parkinson disease, by the appearance of parkinsonism within one year of  cognitive or behavioral decline. The main component of Lewy bodies is alpha-synuclein. Accumulating evidence suggests that its aggregation constitutes  one of the first steps preceding Lewy body formation, so that antiaggregation  strategies would be very useful to prevent alpha-synuclein fibril formation.

The NoSAS Score can be used for screening of which disorders?,The NoSAS score can be used for screening of sleep-disordered breathing and Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS).," Context: current MDE. Using a threshold of ≥ 8 points, the NoSAS score identified OSAS in  MDE participants with a sensitivity of 0.79, a specificity of 0.66, a negative  predictive value of 0.91, and a positive predictive value of 0.41. The area  under the ROC curve was 0.72 for NoSAS, 0.66 for STOP-BANG and 0.69 for the  Berlin score (NS). LIMITATIONS: Only 44% of the PsyCoLaus participants had a polysomnography. The  studied population was mainly of Caucasian ancestry and above 40 years of age.  CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study assessing the performance of screening  tools for OSAS in MDE. The NoSAS score is a simple and efficient screening tool  for OSAS in this population, and may be a helpful instrument for clinicians.  ,  Context: 34.8% and 44.4%).

While the SBQ questionnaire is more widely used, it is necessary to further evaluate the diagnostic value of NoSAS score.  ,  Context: FINDINGS: We used the 2121 participants from the HypnoLaus cohort who were  assessed between Sept 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013. The NoSAS score, which ranges  from 0 to 17, allocates 4 points for having a neck circumference of more than 40  cm, 3 points for having a body-mass index of 25 kg/m(2) to less than 30 kg/m(2)  or 5 points for having a body-mass index of 30 kg/m(2) or more, 2 points for  snoring, 4 points for being older than 55 years of age, and 2 points for being  male. Using a threshold of 8 points or more, the NoSAS score identified  individuals at risk of clinically significant sleep-disordered breathing, with  an area under the curve (AUC) of 0·74 (95% CI 0·72-0·76). It showed an even higher performance in the EPISONO cohort, with an AUC of 0·81 (0·77-0·85).

While the SBQ questionnaire is more widely used, it  is necessary to further evaluate the diagnostic value of NoSAS score.  ,  Context: recommended. We aimed to develop a screening tool allowing identification of  individuals at risk of sleep-disordered breathing. METHODS: We used the participants from the population-based HypnoLaus cohort in  Lausanne, Switzerland, who had a clinical assessment and polysomnography at  home, to build a clinical score (the NoSAS score) using multiple factor analysis  and logistic regression to identify people likely to have clinically significant  sleep-disordered breathing. The NoSAS score was externally validated in an  independent sleep cohort (EPISONO). We compared its performance to existing  screening scores (STOP-Bang and Berlin scores). FINDINGS: We used the 2121 participants from the HypnoLaus cohort who were  assessed between Sept 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013. The NoSAS score, which ranges  from 0 to 17, allocates 4 points for having a neck circumference of more than 40 cm, 3 points for having a body-mass index of 25 kg/m(2) to less than 30 kg/m(2)  or 5 points for having a body-mass index of 30 kg/m(2) or more, 2 points for  snoring, 4 points for being older than 55 years of age, and 2 points for being  ,  Context: RESULTS: Of the 294 patients, 70.7% were male, aged 53.5±12.1 years, with a neck  circumference of 41.0±3.6cm and a BMI of 30.8±5.1kg/m2. OSA was present in 84.0%  of the patients, 34.8% with moderate OSA and 36.4% severe OSA. Using the NoSAS  model for the prediction of all OSA, moderate/severe OSA and severe OSA, the  area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) was 0.770 (IC95%: (0.703;  0.837), p<0.001), 0.746 (IC95%: (0.691; 0.802), p<0.001) and 0.686 (IC95%:  (0.622; 0.749), p<0.001), respectively, thus confirming the diagnostic ability  of the NoSAS model. With a NoSAS score ≥7, the sensitivity and positive  predictive value (PPV) were 94.3% and 87.6% for all OSA, 94.9% and 62.8% for moderate/severe OSA and 100% and 33.8% for severe OSA, respectively. With the  same cut-off, the negative predictive value (NPV) for moderate/severe and severe  OSA were 67.9% and 100%, respectively. Each increase in the NoSAS score was associated with an increase in the probability of OSA, reaching a 97% OSA  probability for a score of 17.

Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,"No, a selective sweep typically reduces linked genetic variation due to strong positive selection."," Context:  A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to  strong positive selection. If s is the fitness advantage of a homozygote for the  beneficial allele and h its dominance coefficient, it is usually assumed that h=1/2, i.e. the beneficial allele is co-dominant. We complement existing theory  for selective sweeps by assuming that h is any value in [0, 1].

In these situations, adaptation should commonly  produce 'soft' selective sweeps, where multiple adaptive alleles sweep through  the population at the same time, either because the alleles were already present  as standing genetic variation or arose independently by recurrent de novo mutations. Most well-known examples of rapid molecular adaptation indeed show  signatures of such soft selective sweeps. Here, we review the current  understanding of the mechanisms that produce soft sweeps and the approaches used for their identification in population genomic data. We argue that soft sweeps  might be the dominant mode of adaptation in many species.  ,  Context:  Selective sweeps are typically associated with a local reduction of genetic  diversity around the adaptive site. However, selective sweeps can also quickly  carry neutral mutations to observable population frequencies if they arise early in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele. We show that the interplay  between mutation and exponential amplification through hitchhiking results in a  characteristic frequency spectrum of the resulting novel haplotype variation that depends only on the ratio of the mutation rate and the selection  coefficient of the sweep.

Proteolytic maturation of this precursor protein is  performed by the proteasome complex. Here we show that Tax binds specifically to  two subunits of the 20S proteasome, HsN3 and HC9. This interaction is weakened  with HsN3 and lost for HC9 when a mutant of Tax is substituted that is  selectively defective for NF-kappa B activation. Immunoprecipitation shows that  p1O5 binds weakly to HC9 and that this interaction is reinforced by Tax. No bridging function of Tax between p1O5 and HsN3 was observed. From these results,  we propose that Tax accelerates the proteolytic maturation of P105 by favouring  its anchorage to the proteasome.  ,  Context: METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and oncology conference proceedings were searched for  relevant studies. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials of cancer  patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors with adequate data on hepatic AEs.  RESULTS: A total of nine randomized controlled trials with a variety of solid  tumors were eligible for the meta-analysis. The use of PD-1 inhibitors  significantly increased the risk of developing all-grade hepatic AEs but not for  high-grade hepatic AEs in comparison with chemotherapy or everolimus control.  Additionally, the risk of all-grade and high-grade hepatic AEs with a  nivolumab/ipilimumab combination was substantially higher than ipilimumab. No significant differences in the risk of all-grade and high-grade hepatic AEs were  found between PD-1 inhibitors monotherapy and ipilimumab. CONCLUSION: While the use of PD-1 inhibitors is associated with an increased risk of developing hepatic AEs in cancer patients, this is primarily for lower  grade events.  ,  Context: II/III trials for psoriasis and PsA. AREAS COVERED: Bimekizumab is not currently licensed for use. A literature  search identified clinical trials examining the efficacy and safety of  bimekizumab for psoriasis and PsA, and these were critically appraised. EXPERT OPINION: Clinical trials of bimekizumab have been promising,  demonstrating a rapid onset of response and superior efficacy compared to three  currently licensed biologics: secukinumab, ustekinumab, and adalimumab.  Bimekizumab maintains a high level of efficacy with maintenance dosing intervals  of 8 weeks, compared with 4 weeks for currently licensed IL-17A antagonists. No unexpected adverse events have been identified, although mild-to-moderate fungal  infections occur in approximately 10%.

Does oncogene-induced DNA replication stress inhibit genomic instability?,"No, oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability in cancer.

Here, we sequenced the exomes of 24,  mostly precancerous, colon polyps. Analysis of the sequences revealed mutations  in the APC, CTNNB1, and BRAF genes as the presumptive cancer-initiating events  and many passenger SNSs. We used the number of SNSs in the various lesions to  calculate mutation rates for normal colon and adenomas and found that colon  adenomas exhibit a mutator phenotype. Interestingly, the SNSs in the adenomas  mapped more often than expected within very large genes, where focal deletions  in response to DNA replication stress also map. We propose that single-stranded  DNA generated in response to oncogene-induced replication stress compromises the repair of deaminated cytosines and other damaged bases, leading to the observed  SNS mutator phenotype.  ,  Context:  Origin licensing builds a fundamental basis for genome stability in DNA  replication. Recent studies reported that deregulation of origin licensing is  associated with replication stress in precancerous lesions. The heterohexameric complex of minichromosome maintenance proteins (MCM2-7 complex) plays an  essential role in origin licensing. Previously, we reported the recovery of the  first viable Mcm mutant allele (named Mcm4(Chaos3)) in mice. The Mcm4(Chaos3) allele destabilizes the MCM2-7 complex, leading to chromosome instability and  the formation of spontaneous tumors in Mcm4(Chaos3) homozygous mice. Supporting  our finding, a recent study reported that mice with reduced expression of MCM2  ,  Context: However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and  it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication  program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic  approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation  throughout the genome. Instead, depletion of PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1  results in the accumulation of DNA damage and an ATR-dependent cell cycle  arrest. Coincident with the ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest, we find increased DNA damage that is specifically limited to late replicating regions of the  Drosophila genome, suggesting that PR-Set7-mediated monomethylation of H4K20 is  critical for maintaining the genomic integrity of late replicating domains.  ,  Context: creating two bi-directional replication forks and initiating DNA replication. As  replication forks move along chromatin DNA, they frequently stall due to the  presence of a great number of replication barriers on chromatin DNA, such as  secondary DNA structures, protein/DNA complexes, DNA lesions, gene  transcription. Stalled forks must require checkpoint regulation for their  stabilization. Otherwise, stalled forks will collapse, which results in  incomplete DNA replication and genomic instability. This short review gives a  concise introduction regarding the current understanding of replication  initiation and replication fork stabilization.

Diagnosed with an abdominal tumor 10 years ago during routine screening, that  progressively grew to encompass the entire abdominal area, with symptoms of intestinal obstruction. DISCUSSION: Hemophilic pseudotumor appears as a painless tumor of slow growth  that can compress vital organs producing bone destruction, muscle and skin  necrosis. The tumor may have fistulas or break spontaneously.  ,  Context:  Hemophilic pseudotumor is a rare but well-known complication of hemophilia  manifesting as recurrent hemorrhage and progressive enlargement of hematoma. A  patient with severe hemophilia has 1% to 2% chance to develop pseudotumor. The chronic pressure of osseous hemorrhage usually results in bone destruction or  resorption.

This  type of hydrocephalus is caused by impaired cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption  without any obstruction in the ventricular system and is associated with normal  cerebrospinal fluid pressure.

However, a substantial number of patients do not respond well to surgical treatment, complication rates are high and there is  often a need for further surgery. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an  alternative surgical intervention. It has been suggested that ETV may lead to better outcomes, including fewer complications.

It  carries many features which are distinctive of IF subunit proteins. These  include the T/SSYRRXF/Y motif in the head domain, and the intermediate filament  signature consensus, [I/V]-X-[T/A/C/I]-Y-[R/K/H]-X-[L/M]-L-[D/E], located in the  carboxyl terminus of the central helical rod. Unlike other 3' UTR sequences, the  3' UTR of the zebrafish cDNA sequence has two CAYUG elements flanking a single  polyadenylation site. The temporal and spatial expression patterns of desmin  mRNA during early zebrafish development were studied. The onset of desmin expression occurred at the 1-3 somite stage (11 hpf). It increased throughout  somitogenesis, with maximum expression at the Prim-6 stage (25 hpf), and  decreasing expression towards the protruding-mouth stage (72 hpf). Desmin mRNA was initially localised exclusively to the somites, but was subsequently also  detected in other musculature in the developing heart and fins.

Furthermore, some genes show specific expression patterns in certain tissues at  certain stages, suggesting the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the  development of these systems.

In humans,  thousands of circRNA transcriptional products precisely express in specific developmental stages, tissues and cell types. Due to their stability and  specificity, circRNAs are ideal biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.  To provide an integrated and standardized circRNA expression profile for human cancers, we performed extensive data curation across 11 technical platforms,  collecting 48 expression profile data sets for 18 cancer types and amassing  860 751 expression records.

A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in  children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19, initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after  exposure to the COVID-19. MIS-C is a disorder in which inflammation could occur  in different parts of the body. The disease puts pressure on the heart, as blood vessels leading towards the heart get inflamed and incapable of carrying  adequate blood, hence producing cardiac complications in children hospitalised  with MIS-C. The problem seems to be associated with COVID-19 in children;  ,  Context:  OBJECTIVE: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with  coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a rare and challenging diagnosis requiring  early treatment. The diagnostic criteria involve clinical, laboratory, and complementary tests. This review aims to draw pediatrician attention to this  diagnosis, suggesting early treatment strategies, and proposing a pediatric  emergency care flowchart. SOURCES: The PubMed/MEDLINE/WHO COVID-19 databases were reviewed for original  and review articles, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, case series, and  recommendations from medical societies and health organizations published  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: : Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated  with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging condition that was first  identified in paediatrics at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The condition is also known as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally  associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (PIMS-TS or  PIMS), and multiple definitions have been established for this condition that share overlapping features with Kawasaki Disease and toxic shock syndrome. METHODS: : A review was conducted to identify literature describing the  epidemiology of MIS-C, published up until March 9, 2021. A database established  ,  Context: disease (KD)-like hyperinflammatory illness have been reported in Europe and the  United States during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic with or without shock and  cardiac dysfunction. These patients tested positive for the polymerase chain  reaction or antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 or had a history of recent exposure to  COVID-19. Clinicians managing such patients coined new terms for this new  illness, such as COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory response syndrome,  pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19,  or COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).  The pathogenesis of MIS-C is unclear; however, it appears similar to that of cytokine storm syndrome. MIS-C shows clinical features similar to KD, but  differences between them exist with respect to age, sex, and racial  distributions and proportions of patients with shock or cardiac dysfunction. Recommended treatments for MIS-C include intravenous immunoglobulin,  corticosteroids, and inotropic or vasopressor support. For refractory patients,  monoclonal antibody to interleukin-6 receptor (tocilizumab), interleukin-1  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with  COVID-19 (MIS-C) has been described as a novel and often severe presentation of  SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. We aimed to describe the characteristics of children admitted to Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) presenting with  MIS-C in comparison with those admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection with other  features such as COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: A multicentric prospective national registry including 47 PICUs was  carried out. Data from children admitted with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or  fulfilling MIS-C criteria (with or without SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmation) were  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated  with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has recently been described. OBJECTIVE. The  purpose of our study was to evaluate the imaging findings of MIS-C associated with COVID-19. METHODS. Imaging studies and medical records of patients (age  range, 0-20 years) admitted with MIS-C between April 22 and May 21, 2020, were  retrospectively reviewed. Thoracic imaging studies were evaluated for parenchymal, mediastinal and hilar, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Abdominal  imaging studies were evaluated for abnormalities of solid viscera, hollow  viscera, and the peritoneum as well as the mesentery and retroperitoneum.

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel, life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition that develops in children a few weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have evidence of a marked inflammatory state. Most patients show an increase in the level of at least four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, ferritin, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, and triglycerides). Therapy is primarily with immunomodulators, suggesting that the disease is driven by post-infectious immune dysregulation.

List the deadliest viruses in the world.,"Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV), which have reported case fatality rates of up to 90% in some outbreaks."," Context:  The filoviruses, Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV), are among the  deadliest viruses that cause disease in humans, with reported case fatality  rates of up to 90% in some outbreaks. The high virulence of EBOV and MARV is largely attributed to the ability of these viruses to interfere with the host  immune response. Currently, there are no approved vaccines or postexposure  therapeutics, and treatment options for patients infected with EBOV are limited to supportive care. In this review, we discuss mechanisms of EBOV pathogenesis  and its ability to subvert host immunity as well as several vaccines and  therapeutics with respect to their evaluation in small animal models, nonhuman  ,  Context:  Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the deadliest form of malaria, and  human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) are among the most important health  problems worldwide, being responsible for a total of 4 million deaths annually. Due to their extensive overlap in developing regions, especially Sub-Saharan  Africa, co-infections with malaria and HIV-1 are common, but the interplay  between the two diseases is poorly understood. Epidemiological reports have suggested that malarial infection transiently enhances HIV-1 replication and  increases HIV-1 viral load in co-infected individuals. Because this viremia  stays high for several weeks after treatment with antimalarials, this phenomenon  ,  Context: This year marks the 100th anniversary of the deadliest event in human history.

The  descendants of the 1918 virus remain today; as endemic influenza viruses, they  cause significant mortality each year. Although the ability to predict influenza pandemics remains no better than it was a century ago, numerous scientific  advances provide an important head start in limiting severe disease and death  from both current and future influenza viruses: identification and substantial characterization of the natural history and pathogenesis of the 1918 causative  virus itself, as well as hundreds of its viral descendants; development of  moderately effective vaccines; improved diagnosis and treatment of  ,  Context: Bluetongue virus (BTV) genome contains ten double-stranded RNA segments. The  sequence of the plus strand of each of the BTV genomic double-stranded RNAs is  the same as that of its mRNA, which encodes for a single viral protein, except  the smallest S4 segment which can encode for two nonstructural proteins,  primarily for the release assistance of the viral progeny. The separation and  isolation of each BTV dsRNA segment and viral protein have provided extensive  data related to its viral infection, pathology, suppression of host cellular  functions, and eventual apoptosis of the infected host cells. This cytoplasmic  virus is also an animal killer that costs the U.S. livestock industry at least $125 million yearly. However, this virus has no known effect on humans. Thus, it  is very safe to carry out investigation with the virus, preferably in a BSL-2  laboratory.  ,  Context: This year marks the 100th anniversary of the deadliest event in human history.

Microtubules are subject to various covalent  modifications. One such modification is tubulin acetylation, which is associated  with stable microtubules and conserved from protists to humans. In the past  three decades, this reversible modification has been studied extensively. In  mammals, its level is mainly governed by opposing actions of α-tubulin  acetyltransferase 1 (ATAT1) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Knockout studies  of the mouse enzymes have yielded new insights into biological functions of  tubulin acetylation. Abnormal levels of this modification are linked to neurological disorders, cancer, heart diseases and other pathological  conditions, thereby yielding important therapeutic implications. This review  summarizes related studies and concludes that tubulin acetylation is important for regulating microtubule architecture and maintaining microtubule integrity.  Together with detyrosination, glutamylation and other modifications, tubulin  acetylation may form a unique 'language' to regulate microtubule structure and  function.  ,  Context: Cytoskeleton remodelling is a prerequisite step for the morphological transition  from preadipocytes to mature adipocytes. Although microtubules play a pivotal  role in organizing cellular structure, regulation of microtubule dynamics during  adipogenesis remains unclear. In the present paper we show that acetylation of  α-tubulin is up-regulated during adipogenesis, and adipocyte development is  dependent on α-tubulin acetylation, as expression of an acetylation-resistant  α-tubulin mutant significantly inhibits adipogenesis. Moreover, acetylation of  α-tubulin is under the control of the acetyltransferase MEC-17 and deacetylases  SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6). Adipocyte development is inhibited in MEC-17-knockdown cells, but enhanced in MEC-17-overexpressing  cells. Finally, we show that katanin, a microtubule-severing protein with  enhanced activity on acetylated α-tubulin, is actively involved in adipogenesis.

What is measured through the NOMe-Seq methodology?,"NOMe-seq measures chromatin accessibility and endogenous DNA methylation on single molecules. It simultaneously profiles chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation, allowing for the identification of open and closed chromatin regions, as well as the detection of regulatory elements"," Context: Gaining insights into the regulatory mechanisms that underlie the  transcriptional variation observed between individual cells necessitates the  development of methods that measure chromatin organization in single cells. Here  I adapted Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome-sequencing (NOMe-seq) to measure  chromatin accessibility and endogenous DNA methylation in single cells  (scNOMe-seq). scNOMe-seq recovered characteristic accessibility and DNA methylation patterns at DNase hypersensitive sites (DHSs). An advantage of  scNOMe-seq is that sequencing reads are sampled independently of the  accessibility measurement. scNOMe-seq therefore controlled for fragment loss, which enabled direct estimation of the fraction of accessible DHSs within  individual cells. In addition, scNOMe-seq provided high resolution of chromatin  accessibility within individual loci which was exploited to detect footprints of  ,  Context: MOTIVATION: Chromatin accessibility plays a key role in epigenetic regulation of  gene activation and silencing.

AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CAME is implemented in java and the program is  freely available online at http://sourceforge.net/projects/came/.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that is enriched in  heterochromatin but depleted at active promoters and enhancers. However, the  debate on whether or not DNA methylation is a reliable indicator of high  nucleosome occupancy has not been settled. For example, the methylation levels  of DNA flanking CTCF sites are higher in linker DNA than in nucleosomal DNA,  while other studies have shown that the nucleosome core is the preferred site of  methylation. In this study, we make progress toward understanding these  conflicting phenomena by implementing a bioinformatics approach that combines  MNase-seq and NOMe-seq data and by comprehensively profiling DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy throughout the human genome. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that increasing methylated CpG density is  correlated with nucleosome occupancy in the total genome and within nearly all subgenomic regions.

"How is connected ""isolated Non-compaction cardiomyopathy"" with dilated cardiomyopathy?","Isolated non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) can overlap with dilated cardiomyopathy. Features of LV noncompaction can also occur in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and some cases of NCCM may be associated"," Context: Isolated noncompaction of the left ventricle (LV) is a rare disorder, classified  as a primary genetic cardiomyopathy by the American Heart Association. The  European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial  Diseases classified LV noncompaction as an unclassified cardiomyopathy. LV  noncompaction cardiomyopathy characterized by the following features: 1) an  altered myocardial wall with prominent trabeculae and deep intertrabecular recesses resulting in thickened myocardium with two layers, consisting of  compacted and noncompacted myocardium and 2) continuity between the left  ventricular cavity and the deep intertrabecular recesses, which are filled with blood from the ventricular cavity, without evidence of communication with the  epicardial coronary artery system. Features of LV noncompaction can overlap with  dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (especially the apical  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: Isolated non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) was first described in  1984. This disorder, a primary genetic cardiomyopathy, is now attracting  increased attention. METHOD: The current state of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of NCCM are discussed on  the basis of a review of selected literature as well as the authors' personal  experience. RESULTS: The pathogenesis of NCCM is thought to involve a genetically determined disturbance of the myocardial compaction process during fetal endomyocardial  morphogenesis. It is not accompanied by any other cardiac anomalies.  Echocardiography is the diagnostic method of choice. The diagnosis is based on  ,  Context: Cardiomyopathies are classified according to distinct morphological  characteristics. They occur relatively frequent and are an important cause of  mortality and morbidity. Isolated ventricular non-compaction or non-compaction  cardiomyopathy (NCCM) is characterized by an excessively thickened endocardial  layer with deep intertrabecular recesses, reminiscent of the myocardium during  early embryogenesis. Aims Autosomal-dominant as well as X-linked inheritance for NCCM has been described and several loci have been associated with the disease.  Nevertheless, a major genetic cause for familial NCCM remains to be identified.  Methods and Results We describe, in two separate autosomal-dominant NCCM families, the identification of mutations in the sarcomeric cardiac beta-myosin  heavy chain gene (MYH7), known to be associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  (HCM), restricted cardiomyopathy (RCM), and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).  ,  Context:  Noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium is a recently recognized genetic  cardiomyopathy. The left ventricle is the most affected site, but right  ventricular involvement has been reported in some cases. Diagnosis is made with 2-dimensional echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. The major  clinical manifestations are heart failure, arrhythmias and embolic events. A  20-year old man had left and right ventricular noncompaction complicated by severe pulmonary hypertension, which is one of the first cases of biventricular  noncompaction associated with severe pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary  hypertension may be a consequence of increased pulmonary venous pressures caused  ,  Context: recesses resulting in thickened myocardium with two layers, consisting of  compacted and noncompacted myocardium and 2) continuity between the left  ventricular cavity and the deep intertrabecular recesses, which are filled with  blood from the ventricular cavity, without evidence of communication with the  epicardial coronary artery system. Features of LV noncompaction can overlap with  dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (especially the apical  variant), and restrictive cardiomyopathy. The phenotypic expression can vary  considerably within the same family. The LV noncompaction can rarely occur as a  transient phenomenon during myocarditis. We present the case of a 23-year-old patient, admitted to our Department for cardiac evaluation because of ECG  changes and cardiac enlargement revealed at thoracic radiography. She had a  history of chronic toxoplasmosis. An echocardiography was performed revealing left ventricular enlargement with severe systolic and diastolic dysfunction,  diffuse hypokinesia and signs of isolated left ventricular non-compaction.

Which human gene encode for DNA polymerase θ?,POLQ gene encodes DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) in mammalian cells.," Context:  DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi. Pol θ is encoded by the POLQ gene in mammalian cells. The  C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a  helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol θ is important in  the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks  arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during  diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by  ,  Context:  DNA polymerase theta (pol θ) is encoded in the genomes of many eukaryotes,  though not in fungi.

Pol θ is the defining enzyme for a pathway  of DSB repair termed ""alternative end-joining"" (altEJ) or ""theta-mediated end-joining."" This pathway contributes significantly to the radiation resistance  of mammalian cells. It also modulates accuracy in repair of breaks that occur at  stalled DNA replication forks, during diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, during repair of CRISPR-Cas9, and in many DNA integration events.  Pol θ is a potentially important clinical target, particularly for cancers  deficient in other break repair strategies. The enzyme is uniquely able to  ,  Context: (one-third of the species analyzed) or multisegmental (the rest). Multisegment  cGOFs were further classified into symmetric or asymmetric according to segment  orientations toward the origin-terminus axis. The cGOFs in Gram-positive species  are exclusively symmetric and often reversible in orientation, as opposed to  those of the Gram-negative bacteria, which are all asymmetric and irreversible.  Meanwhile, all species showing strong strand-biased gene distribution contain  symmetric cGOFs and often specific DnaE (α subunit of DNA polymerase III)  isoforms. Furthermore, functional evaluations revealed that cGOF genes are hub  associated with regard to cellular activities, and the stability of cGOF provides efficient indexes for scaffold orientation as demonstrated by  assembling virtual and empirical genome drafts. cGOFs show species specificity,  and the symmetry of multisegmental cGOFs is conserved among taxa and constrained by DNA polymerase-centric strand-biased gene distribution. The definition of  species-specific cGOFs provides powerful guidance for genome assembly and other  structure-based analysis.  ,  Context:  DNA polymerase alpha (pol alpha) holds a special position among the growing  family of eukaryotic DNA polymerases. In fact, pol alpha is associated with DNA  primase to form a four subunit complex and, as a consequence, is the only enzyme able to start DNA synthesis de novo. Because of this peculiarity the major role  of the DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex (pol-prim) is in the initiation of  DNA replication at chromosomal origins and in the discontinuous synthesis of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand of the replication fork. However,  pol-prim seems to play additional roles in other complex cellular processes,  such as the response to DNA damage, telomere maintenance, and the epigenetic  ,  Context: To elucidate the behavior of DNA polymerase eta against the oxidized purine  nucleotides, we determined the utilization efficiency of 2-hydroxy-dATP and  8-hydroxy-dGTP by the recombinant yeast DNA polymerase eta using the primer  extension assay with the synthetic oligonucleotide template-primers, and  compared those by DNA polymerase alpha. Results indicate that DNA polymerase eta  incorporates 2-hydroxy-dATP opposite template G in addition to template T and 8-hydroxy-dGTP opposite A in addition to C, respectively. Kinetic analysis  revealed that the rate of mutation caused by 2-OH-dATP and 8-OH-dGTP with DNA  polymerase eta should be much higher than those with DNA polymerase alpha.

Thus, Rif1 establishes the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at early-S-phase. Overall, Rif1 plays crucial roles in determining the replication timing domain structures in human cells through regulating higher-order chromatin architecture.

What is the Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein?,"The Drosophila melanogaster Groucho (Gro) protein is a transcriptional corepressor that directly interacts with the histone deacetylase Rpd3. It has five identifiable regions, including the amino-terminal glutamine-rich Q"," Context:  The Drosophila Groucho (Gro) protein was the founding member of the family of  transcriptional co-repressor proteins that now includes the transducin-like  enhancer of split (TLE) and Grorelated gene (Grg) proteins in vertebrates. Gro family proteins do not bind DNA directly, but are recruited by a diverse profile  of transcription factors, including members of the Hes, Runx, Nkx, LEF1/Tcf,  Pax, Six and c-Myc families. The primary structure of Gro proteins includes five identifiable regions, of which the most highly conserved are the amino-terminal  glutamine-rich Q domain and the carboxy-terminal WD-repeat domain. The Q domain  contains two coiled-coil motifs that facilitate oligomerization into tetramers  ,  Context:  Groucho (Gro) is a Drosophila melanogaster transcriptional corepressor that  directly interacts with the histone deacetylase Rpd3. Although previous studies  suggest that this interaction is required for repression of Gro-responsive reporters in cultured cells, the in vivo significance of this interaction and  the mechanism by which it leads to repression remain largely unexplored. In this  study, we show that Gro is partially dependent on Rpd3 for repression, supporting the idea that Rpd3-mediated repression is one mode of Gro-mediated  repression. We demonstrate that Gro colocalizes with Rpd3 to the chromatin of a  target gene and that this is accompanied by the deacetylation of specific  ,  Context: The murine grg (Groucho-related gene) products are believed to interact with  transcription factors and repress transcription, thereby regulating cell  proliferation and differentiation. Most proteins in the grg family contain all  of the domains found in the Drosophila Groucho protein, including the S/P  (Ser-Pro-rich) domain required for interaction with transcription factors and  the WD40 domain, which is thought to interact with other proteins. However, at least two Grg proteins contain only the amino-terminal Q (glutamine-rich)  domain. We examined whether the Q domain is used for dimerization between Grg  proteins, using the yeast two-hybrid system and binding assays with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. We found that Grg proteins are able to dimerize  through the Q domain and that dimerization requires a core of 50 amino acids.  Surprisingly, the dimerization does not require the leucine zipper located  within the Q domain.  ,  Context:  The groucho-related genes (Grg) of the mouse comprise at least four family  members. In Drosophila, groucho is one of the neurogenic genes that participates  in the Notch signalling pathway. The Groucho protein interacts with Hairy-related transcription factors to regulate segmentation, neurogenesis and  sex determination. Thus, by analogy to the Drosophila proteins, murine Grg  proteins may interact with mammalian Hairy and E(spl) homologues (Hes proteins) and take part in a signalling pathway downstream of murine Notch.

Is H4K20 methylation associated with DNA replication?,"H4K20 methylation is linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair, and DNA replication. Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated histone"," Context: Maintenance of genomic integrity is essential to ensure normal organismal  development and to prevent diseases such as cancer. Nuclear DNA is packaged into  chromatin, and thus genome maintenance can be influenced by distinct chromatin  environments. In particular, post-translational modifications of histones have  emerged as key regulators of genomic integrity. Intense research during the past  few years has revealed histone H4 lysine 20 methylation (H4K20me) as critically  important for the biological processes that ensure genome integrity, such as DNA  damage repair, DNA replication and chromatin compaction. The distinct H4K20  methylation states are mediated by SET8/PR-Set7 that catalyses monomethylation of H4K20, whereas SUV4-20H1 and SUV4-20H2 enzymes mediate further H4K20  methylation to H4K20me2 and H4K20me3. Disruption of these H4K20-specific histone  methyltransferases leads to genomic instability, demonstrating the important functions of H4K20 methylation in genome maintenance. In this review, we explain  molecular mechanisms underlying these defects and discuss novel ideas for  furthering our understanding of genome maintenance in higher eukaryotes.  ,  Context: The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to  chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.  Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated  histone methyltransferase PR-Set7. PR-Set7 depletion in mammalian cells results  in defective S phase progression and the accumulation of DNA damage, which has  been partially attributed to defects in origin selection and activation.  However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and  it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication  program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation throughout the genome.

Identification of histone  methyltransferases and demethylases, as well as proteins that recognize  methylated lysines, has clarified the role of each methylation event in  regulating different biological pathways. Methylation of histone H4 lysine 20  (H4K20me) plays critical roles in diverse cellular processes such as gene  expression, cell cycle progression and DNA damage repair, with each of the three  degrees of methylation (mono-, di- and tri-methylation) making a unique contribution.

Consistent with these activities, the HCF-1C subunit can associate with  chromatin independently of the HCF-1N subunit and regulates the expression of  the H4-K20 methyltransferase PR-Set7. Indeed, upregulation of PR-Set7 expression  upon loss of HCF-1 leads to improper mitotic H4-K20 methylation and cytokinesis  defects. These results establish the HCF-1C subunit as an important M phase  regulator and suggest that H4-K20 methylation status contributes to chromosome  behavior during mitosis and proper cytokinesis.

U1 Adaptors can inhibit  both endogenous and reporter genes in a sequence-specific manner. Comparison of  U1 Adaptors with small interfering RNA (siRNA) using a genome-wide microarray analysis indicates that U1 Adaptors have limited off-target effects and no  detectable adverse effects on splicing.

"Are the human bombesin receptors, GRPR and NMBR, frequently overexpressed G-protein-coupled-receptors by lung-cancers?","No, there is no mention of human bombesin receptors, GRPR and NMBR, or their expression in lung cancers."," Context: neuroblastoma. Of these 45 somatic alterations, 15 were also detected in the  primary tumor and bone marrow biopsy, while the other 30 were unique to the  index tumor, indicating accumulation of de novo mutations during therapy.  Furthermore, transcriptome sequencing on the 3 tumors demonstrated only 3 out of  the 15 commonly mutated genes (LPAR1, GATA2, and NUFIP1) had high level of  expression of the mutant alleles, suggesting potential oncogenic driver roles of  these mutated genes. Among them, the druggable G-protein coupled receptor LPAR1  was highly expressed in all tumors. Cells expressing the LPAR1 R163W mutant  demonstrated a significantly increased motility through elevated Rho signaling, but had no effect on growth. Therefore, this study highlights the need for  multiple biopsies and sequencing during progression of a cancer and  combinatorial DNA and RNA sequencing approach for systematic identification of  expressed driver mutations.  ,  Context:  Despite the fact that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate numerous  physiological processes and represent targets for therapeutics for a vast array  of diseases, their role in tumor biology is under appreciated. Protease-activated receptors (PARs) form a family which belongs to GPCR class A.  PAR1&2 emerge with a central role in epithelial malignancies. Although the part  of PAR1&2 in cancer is on the rise, their underlying signaling events are poorly understood. We review hereby past, present, and future cancer-associated PAR  biology. Mainly, their role in physiological (placenta-cytotophobalst) and  patho-physiological invasion processes. The identification and characterization  ,  Context:  INTRODUCTION: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is mutated in 15% of  adenocarcinomas of the lung. In addition, the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)  is altered in 8% of adenocarcinomas of the lung. Treatment of EGFR mutant and ALK translocation-positive tumors in NSCLC with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)  results in a dramatic therapeutic response and has revolutionized therapy.  Unfortunately, resistance to TKIs invariably develops. Many promising new therapies are under investigation to overcome the resistance. AREAS COVERED: We analyzed the current primary literature and recent national  meetings to evaluate the clinical characteristics and therapeutic implications  ,  Context: PURPOSE: Because evasion of tumor suppression is a critical step in cancer  development, cancer cells have developed a variety of mechanisms to circumvent  the influence of tumor suppressive pathways. Thus, genes that negatively  regulate tumor suppressors could be considered novel types of oncogenes such as  Bmi-1 repressing p16Ink4a and inhibiting p53 and were found to be frequently  up-regulated in a variety of cancers. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which reportedly plays a crucial role as a tumor suppressor, is  activated in number of lung adenocarcinomas, which is seemingly at odds with its  role as a tumor suppressor. METHODS: We examined 10 lung adenocarcinomas and corresponding normal tissues  and determined the expression levels of a variety of tumor suppressor proteins  through real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry and  ,  Context:  PURPOSE: MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) was reported as being overexpressed in various  human cancerous tissues, but its expression in cancerous serum was not unanimous  in different laboratories. On the base of optimizing experimental design and improving trial protocol, we wanted to know whether the circulating microRNA-21  was dysregulated in the common solid cancers. METHODS: Using SYBR green real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, we detected the expression of circulating miR-21 in 174 patients with solid cancers  and 39 normal control subjects, including breast cancer, esophageal cancer,  gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer. Furthermore, we analyzed the  ,  Context: Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has diverse physiological roles as a  neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (1). It is involved in the  regulation and modulation of sleep, affective and personality behaviors, and  pain. It also is a regulator of smooth muscle function and platelet aggregation.  The brain cortical 5-HT system has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric  disorders, including major depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder,  and schizophrenia (2, 3). The effects of 5-HT are mediated by as many as seven  classes of receptor populations (5-HT1 to 5-HT7), many of which include several  subtypes (4). There are three receptor subtypes within the G-protein–coupled 5-HT2 receptor family: 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C. 5-HT2A receptors are  abundantly present in the cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, hippocampus,  amygdala, dorsal thalamus, hypothalamus, superior colliculus, substantia nigra, pedunculopontine nucleus, legmental area, and myelencephalon (5). 5-HT2A  receptors are involved in mediation of normal and psychotic states, working  memory, regulation of GABAergic and cholinergic neuronal cells, sleep,  ","24147068, 26928551, 25381900, 21164364, 22638884, 21473027","The human bombesin receptors, GRPR and NMBR, are two of the most frequently overexpressed G-protein-coupled-receptors by lung-cancers","20438784, 10545285, 25554218, 18975117, 21060250, 22828605"
Between which types of DNA bases are mutational biases introduced due to directional mutation pressure?,Mutational biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C).," Context: expected to be A = T and G = C at equilibrium without regard to the G + C  content of DNA (type 2 parity rule or PR2). Significant deviations from the  parity rules in the third codon letters of the four-codon amino acids result  mostly from selective biases rather than mutational biases between the two  strands of DNA during evolution. The parity rules lay the foundation for  evaluating the biases in synonymous codon usage in terms of (1) directional  mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational  biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias  mutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional selection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance. The present analysis  shows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of  four-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C content of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly  counteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C  content.  ,  Context: expected to be A = T and G = C at equilibrium without regard to the G + C  content of DNA (type 2 parity rule or PR2).

Directional mutation theory predicts  that when the mutational bias between A/T and G/C nucleotide pairs is  equilibrated with the base composition of a neutral set of DNA nucleotides, the mutation frequency per gene will be much lower than the frequency immediately  after the mutator mutation takes place. This prediction explains the wide  variation of the DNA G+C content among unicellular organisms and possibly also the wide intragenomic heterogeneity of third codon positions for the genes of  multicellular eukaryotes. The present analyses lead to several predictions that  are not consistent with a number of the frequently held assumptions in the field  ,  Context:  The genetic code has been influenced by directional mutation pressure affecting  the base composition of DNA, sometimes in the direction of increased GC content  and at other times, in the direction of AT. Such pressure led to changes in species-specific usages of codons and tRNA anticodons, and also in amino acid  assignments of codons in mitochondria and in several intact organisms. These  code changes are probably recent evolutionary events. The genetic code is not 'frozen', but instead it is still evolving.  ,  Context: theory was based on the assumption that the effect of mutation on a genome is  not random but has a directionality toward higher or lower guanine-plus-cytosine  content of DNA, and this pressure generates directional changes more in neutral  parts of the genome than in functionally significant parts. Now that DNA  sequence data are available, the theory allows the estimation of the extent of  neutrality of directional mutation pressure against selection. Newly defined  parameters were used in the analysis, and two apparently universal constants  were discovered. Analysis of DNA sequence has revealed that practically all  organisms are subject to directional mutation pressure. The theory also offers plausible explanations for the large heterogeneity in guanine-plus-cytosine  content among different parts of the vertebrate genome.  ,  Context: When there are no biases in mutation and selection between the two strands of  DNA, the 12 possible substitution rates of the four nucleotides reduces to six  (type 1 parity rule or PR1), and the intrastrand average base composition is  expected to be A = T and G = C at equilibrium without regard to the G + C  content of DNA (type 2 parity rule or PR2). Significant deviations from the  parity rules in the third codon letters of the four-codon amino acids result  mostly from selective biases rather than mutational biases between the two  strands of DNA during evolution. The parity rules lay the foundation for  evaluating the biases in synonymous codon usage in terms of (1) directional mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational  biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias  mutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional selection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance.

What is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4?,I am uncertain about what is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4.," Context: centres, is challenging because recent studies have expanded the spectrum of  HVMA findings in PCD from grossly abnormal to very subtle. The objective of this  study was to describe the diversity of HVMA findings in genetically confirmed  PCD individuals. HVMA was performed as part of the routine work-up of  individuals with suspected PCD. Subsequent molecular analysis identified  biallelic mutations in the PCD-related genes of 66 individuals. 1072 videos of  these subjects were assessed for correlation with the genotype. Biallelic  mutations (19 novel) were found in 17 genes: DNAI1, DNAI2, DNAH5, DNAH11,  CCDC103, ARMC4, KTU/DNAAF2, LRRC50/DNAAF1, LRRC6, DYX1C1, ZMYND10, CCDC39, CCDC40, CCDC164, HYDIN, RSPH4A and RSPH1. Ciliary beat pattern variations  correlated well with the genetic findings, allowing the classification of  typical HVMA findings for different genetic groups. In contrast, analysis of ciliary beat frequency did not result in additional diagnostic impact. In  conclusion, this study provides detailed knowledge about the diversity of HVMA  findings in PCD and may therefore be seen as a guide to the improvement of PCD  diagnostics.  ,  Context: inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

Videomicrocopy was used to examine ciliary motion in nasal tissue, and nasal  nitric oxide (nNO) was measured; nNO level is typically low with PCD. Eighteen  patients exhibited CD characterized by abnormal ciliary motion and nNO levels  below or near the PCD cutoff values. Patients with CD aged >6 years show  increased respiratory symptoms similar to those seen in PCD. Sequencing of all  14 known PCD genes in 13 heterotaxy patients with CD, 12 without CD, 10 PCD  disease controls, and 13 healthy controls yielded 0.769, 0.417, 1.0, and 0.077  novel variants per patient, respectively. One heterotaxy patient with CD had the PCD causing DNAI1 founder mutation. Another with hyperkinetic ciliary beat had 2  mutations in DNAH11, the only PCD gene known to cause hyperkinetic beat.

We  also highlight some of the questions currently under active investigation  regarding these extracellular membrane vesicles and their potential in  diagnostic and therapeutic applications.  ,  Context: Accumulating evidence suggests that extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a role in  the pathogenesis of lung diseases. These vesicles include exosomes, ectosomes  (ie, microparticles, extracellular vesicles, microvesicles, and shedding  vesicles), and apoptotic bodies. Exosomes are generated by inward budding of the  membrane (endocytosis), subsequent forming of multivesicular bodies, and release  by exocytosis. Ectosomes are formed by outward blebbing from the plasma membrane and are then released by proteolytic cleavage from the cell surface. Apoptotic  bodies are generated on apoptotic cell shrinkage and death. Extracellular  vesicles are released when the cells are activated or undergo apoptosis under inflammatory conditions. The number and types of released EVs are different  according to the pathophysiological status of the disease. Therefore, EVs can be  novel biomarkers for various lung diseases.

Although TORC1 signaling is  repressed by various stresses in yeast, the underlying mechanisms remain  elusive. Here we report that TORC1 signaling upon heat stress is regulated by  stress granules (SGs), which are cytoplasmic foci formed under certain stresses.  Ectopic formation of SGs achieved by Pbp1 overexpression in unstressed cells sequesters TORC1 in this compartment, thereby blunting TORC1 signaling. Upon  heat stress, a physiological SG-inducing condition, TORC1 is also recruited to  SGs, which delays reactivation of TORC1 signaling during recovery from heat stress. Moreover, TORC1 reactivation is directed through SG disassembly,  suggesting that SGs act as a key determinant for TORC1 reactivation during  recovery from heat stress.

The goal of this study was to investigate macrophage-related inflammation in osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: Twenty-five individuals (50 knees) with symptomatic OA of at least one  knee underwent SPECT-CT imaging of both knees and planar imaging of the whole body after injection of Etarfolatide.

The most recent advances in organ and tissue  bioprinting based on the thermal inkjet printing technology are described in  this review. Bioprinting has no or little side effect to the printed mammalian  cells and it can conveniently combine with gene transfection or drug delivery to  the ejected living systems during the precise placement for tissue construction.  With layer-by-layer assembly, 3D tissues with complex structures can be printed  using scanned CT or MRI images. Vascular or nerve systems can be enabled  simultaneously during the organ construction with digital control. Therefore,  bioprinting is the only solution to solve this critical issue in thick and complex tissues fabrication with vascular system. Collectively, bioprinting  based on thermal inkjet has great potential and broad applications in tissue  engineering and regenerative medicine. This review article introduces some important patents related to bioprinting of living systems and the applications  of bioprinting in tissue engineering field.  ,  Context: We recently developed a cell printer (Wilson and Boland, 2003) that enables us  to place cells in positions that mimic their respective positions in organs.  However, this technology was limited to the printing of two-dimensional (2D)  tissue constructs. Here we describe the use of thermosensitive gels to generate  sequential layers for cell printing. The ability to drop cells on previously  printed successive layers provides a real opportunity for the realization of  three-dimensional (3D) organ printing. Organ printing will allow us to print  complex 3D organs with computer-controlled, exact placing of different cell  types, by a process that can be completed in several minutes. To demonstrate the feasibility of this novel technology, we showed that cell aggregates can be  placed in the sequential layers of 3D gels close enough for fusion to occur. We  estimated the optimum minimal thickness of the gel that can be reproducibly generated by dropping the liquid at room temperature onto a heated substrate.  Then we generated cell aggregates with the corresponding (to the minimal  thickness of the gel) size to ensure a direct contact between printed cell  ,  Context: biocompatible materials, cells and supporting components into complex 3D  functional living tissues. 3D bioprinting is being applied to regenerative  medicine to address the need for tissues and organs suitable for  transplantation. Compared with non-biological printing, 3D bioprinting involves  additional complexities, such as the choice of materials, cell types, growth and  differentiation factors, and technical challenges related to the sensitivities  of living cells and the construction of tissues. Addressing these complexities  requires the integration of technologies from the fields of engineering,  biomaterials science, cell biology, physics and medicine. 3D bioprinting has already been used for the generation and transplantation of several tissues,  including multilayered skin, bone, vascular grafts, tracheal splints, heart  tissue and cartilaginous structures. Other applications include developing high-throughput 3D-bioprinted tissue models for research, drug discovery and  toxicology.  ,  Context: engineering. Organ printing has certain advantages: it is an automated approach  that offers a pathway for scalable reproducible mass production of tissue  engineered products; it allows a precised simultaneous 3D positioning of several  cell types; it enables creation tissue with a high level of cell density; it can  solve the problem of vascularization in thick tissue constructs; finally, organ  printing can be done in situ. The ultimate goal of organ-printing technology is  to fabricate 3D vascularized functional living human organs suitable for  clinical implantation.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,YLR228c is the paralog of yeast UPC2.," Context: proteins. Since these proteins are very similar, the effect of mutations in the  YLR228c open reading frame (ORF) was compared with like alterations in UPC2.  First, the YLR228c ORF was insertionally inactivated and crossed with various  UPC2 constructs. Deletion of YLR228c and UPC2 in combination resulted in  nonviability, suggesting that the two proteins have some essential overlapping  function. The upc2-1 point mutation responsible for aerobic sterol uptake was  duplicated in the homologous carboxy region of the YLR228c ORF using  site-directed mutagenesis. This mutation on a high-copy vector resulted in an  increase in sterol uptake compared to an isogenic wild-type strain. The combination of both point mutations resulted in the greatest level of aerobic  sterol uptake. When the YLR228c point mutation was expressed from a low-copy  vector there was little if any effect on sterol uptake. Gas chromatographic analysis of the nonsaponifiable fractions of the various strains showed that the  major sterol for all YLR228c and UPC2 combinations was ergosterol, the consensus  yeast sterol.  ,  Context:  Gene duplication generates new genetic material, which has been shown to lead to  major innovations in unicellular and multicellular organisms. A whole-genome  duplication occurred in the ancestor of Saccharomyces yeast species but 92% of duplicates returned to single-copy genes shortly after duplication. The  persisting duplicated genes in Saccharomyces led to the origin of major  metabolic innovations, which have been the source of the unique biotechnological capabilities in the Baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. What factors have  determined the fate of duplicated genes remains unknown. Here, we report the  first demonstration that the local genome mutation and transcription rates  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Gene duplication, a major evolutionary path to genomic innovation,  can occur at the scale of an entire genome. One such ""whole-genome duplication""  (WGD) event among the Ascomycota fungi gave rise to genes with distinct  biological properties compared to small-scale duplications. RESULTS: We studied the evolution of transcriptional interactions of  whole-genome duplicates, to understand how they are wired into the yeast regulatory system. Our work combines network analysis and modeling of the  large-scale structure of the interactions stemming from the WGD. CONCLUSIONS: The results uncover the WGD as a major source for the evolution of a complex interconnected block of transcriptional pathways. The inheritance of  interactions among WGD duplicates follows elementary ""duplication subgraphs"",  relating ancestral interactions with newly formed ones. Duplication subgraphs  ,  Context: Gene duplication generates new genetic material, which has been shown to lead to  major innovations in unicellular and multicellular organisms. A whole-genome  duplication occurred in the ancestor of Saccharomyces yeast species but 92% of  duplicates returned to single-copy genes shortly after duplication. The  persisting duplicated genes in Saccharomyces led to the origin of major  metabolic innovations, which have been the source of the unique biotechnological capabilities in the Baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. What factors have  determined the fate of duplicated genes remains unknown. Here, we report the  first demonstration that the local genome mutation and transcription rates determine the fate of duplicates. We show, for the first time, a preferential  location of duplicated genes in the mutational and transcriptional hotspots of  S. cerevisiae genome. The mechanism of duplication matters, with whole-genome  ,  Context: Gene redundancy has been observed in yeast, plant and human genomes, and is  thought to be a consequence of whole-genome duplications. Baker's yeast,  Saccharomyces cerevisiae, contains several hundred duplicated genes.  Duplication(s) could have occurred before or after a given speciation. To  understand the evolution of the yeast genome, we analysed orthologues of some of  these genes in several related yeast species. On the basis of the inferred phylogeny of each set of genes, we were able to deduce whether the gene  duplicated and/or specialized before or after the divergence of two yeast  lineages. Here we show that the gene duplications might have occurred as a single event, and that it probably took place before the Saccharomyces and  Kluyveromyces lineages diverged from each other. Further evolution of each  duplicated gene pair-such as specialization or differentiation of the two  ,  Context: The transition between a unicellular yeast form to multicellular filaments is  crucial for budding yeast foraging and the pathogenesis of many fungal pathogens  such as Candida albicans. Here, we examine the role of the related transcription  factors Ecm22 and Upc2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation. Overexpression  of either ECM22 or UPC2 leads to increased filamentation, whereas cells lacking  both ECM22 and UPC2 do not exhibit filamentous growth. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively control the expression of FHN1, NPR1, PRR2 and sterol biosynthesis genes. These  genes all play a positive role in filamentous growth, and their expression is  upregulated during filamentation in an Ecm22/Upc2-dependent manner. Furthermore, ergosterol content increases during filamentous growth. UPC2 expression also  increases during filamentation and is inhibited by the transcription factors  Sut1 and Sut2. The expression of SUT1 and SUT2 in turn is under negative control  ","11208779, 28459980, 20525287, 28459980, 12594514, 26448198",the related transcription factors Ecm22 and Upc2 play a crucial role in Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentation.,"10073572, 24163365, 26448198, 11208779, 28379181, 28986257, 18487346, 1885560, 23385756, 21980509, 24453983"

However, when using classic  variant calling software, the user usually obtains nothing more than a list of  variants that pass the corresponding caller's internal filters. Any expected  mutations (e.g. hotspot mutations), that have not been called by the software,  need to be investigated manually. RESULTS: BBCAnalyzer (Bases By CIGAR Analyzer) provides a novel visual approach  to facilitate this step of time-consuming, manual inspection of common mutation sites. BBCAnalyzer is able to visualize base counts at predefined positions or  regions in any sequence alignment data that are available as BAM files.

However, when using classic  variant calling software, the user usually obtains nothing more than a list of  variants that pass the corresponding caller's internal filters.

The Aho-Corasick algorithm is adapted for  execution in field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices in a manner that optimizes space and performance. In this approach, the traditional Aho-Corasick  finite state machine (FSM) is split into smaller FSMs, operating in parallel,  each of which matches up to 20 peptides in the input translated genome. Each of the smaller FSMs is further divided into five simpler FSMs such that each simple  FSM operates on a single bit position in the input (five bits are sufficient for  representing all amino acids and special symbols in protein sequences).

Describe OligoSTORM,I am uncertain about what OligoSTORM is.," Context: Inhalation of Yersinia pestis results in primary pneumonic plague, a highly  lethal and rapidly progressing necrotizing pneumonia. The disease begins with a  period of extensive bacterial replication in the absence of disease symptoms,  followed by the sudden onset of inflammatory responses that ultimately prove  fatal. Very little is known about the bacterial and host factors that contribute  to the rapid biphasic progression of pneumonic plague. In this work, we analyzed the in vivo transcription kinetics of 288 bacterial open reading frames  previously shown by microarray analysis to be dynamically regulated in the lung.  Using this approach combined with bacterial genetics, we were able to identify five Y. pestis genes that contribute to the development of pneumonic plague.

BACKGROUND: Variability in clopidogrel response might be influenced by  polymorphisms in genes coding for drug metabolism enzymes (cytochrome P450 [CYP]  family), transport proteins (P-glycoprotein) and/or target proteins for the drug  (adenosine diphosphate-receptor P2Y12).

Here we  present the first report that enzymes belonging to the cytochrome P450 (CYP) and  UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) families of drug metabolizing enzymes are expressed and active in vaginal and colorectal tissue using biopsies collected  from healthy volunteers. In doing so, we discovered that dapivirine and  maraviroc, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and an entry inhibitor currently in development as microbicides for HIV PrEP, are  differentially metabolized in colorectal tissue and vaginal tissue. Taken  together, these data should help to guide the optimization of small molecules  being developed for HIV PrEP.  ,  Context: One of the major reasons for late-stage failure of drug candidates is due to  problems uncovered in pharmacokinetics during clinical trials. There is now a  general consensus for earlier consideration of these effects in the drug  discovery process.

Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"HuR regulates transcript stability and translation by binding to adenine and uridine (AU)-rich elements (AREs) located in the 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of mRNAs, antagonizing the rapid decay of"," Context:  HuR, also known as Elavl1, is an RNA-binding protein that regulates embryonic  development, progenitor cell survival, and cell stress responses. The role of  HuR in angiogenesis is not known. Using a myeloid-specific HuR knock-out mouse model (Elavl1Mø KO), we show that HuR expression in bone marrow-derived  macrophages (BMDMs) is needed to maintain the expression of genes enriched in  AU-rich elements and U-rich elements in the 3'-UTR. In addition, BMDMs from Elavl1Mø KO mice also showed alterations in expression of several miRNAs.  Interestingly, computational analysis suggested that miR-200b, which is  up-regulated in Elavl1Mø KO BMDMs, interacts with myeloid mRNAs very close to  ,  Context:  The RNA-binding protein HuR (also known as ELAV1) binds to the 3'-untranslated  region of mRNAs and regulates transcript stability and translation. However, the  in vivo functions of HuR are not well understood. Here, we report that murine HuR is essential for life; postnatal global deletion of Elavl1 induced atrophy  of hematopoietic organs, extensive loss of intestinal villi, obstructive  enterocolitis, and lethality within 10 days. Upon Elavl1 deletion, progenitor cells in the BM, thymus, and intestine underwent apoptosis, whereas quiescent  stem cells and differentiated cells were unaffected. The survival defect of  hematopoietic progenitor cells was cell intrinsic, as transplant of Elavl1-/- BM  ,  Context: Posttranscriptional RNA regulation is important in determining the plasticity of  cellular phenotypes. However, mechanisms of how RNA binding proteins (RBPs)  influence cellular behavior are poorly understood. We show here that the RBP  embryonic lethal abnormal vision like 1 (ELAVL1, also know as HuR) regulates the  alternative splicing of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E nuclear  import factor 1 (Eif4enif1), which encodes an eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E transporter (4E-T) protein and suppresses the expression of capped  mRNAs. In the absence of ELAVL1, skipping of exon 11 of Eif4enif1 forms the  stable, short isoform, 4E-Ts. This alternative splicing event results in the formation of RNA processing bodies (PBs), enhanced turnover of angiogenic mRNAs,  and suppressed sprouting behavior of vascular endothelial cells. Further,  endothelial-specific Elavl1 knockout mice exhibited reduced revascularization  ,  Context: HuR is a ligand for nuclear mRNAs containing adenylate-uridylate-rich (ARE)  elements in the 3'-untranslated region. Once bound to the mRNA, HuR is  recognized by adapter proteins that then facilitate nuclear export of the  complex. In the cytosol, HuR is thought to function to control stability and  translation of its ligand message. We have previously demonstrated that HuR is  constitutively expressed in the 3T3-L1 cells and shuttles from the nucleus to the cytosol, but remains predominantly nuclear in the preadipocytes and that as  the cells differentiate, there is a marked increase in the proportion of HuR in  the cytosol at any time. The GLUT1 glucose transporter is also expressed in both preadipocytes and adipocytes and in vitro RNA gel shifts indicate the mRNA is a  ligand for HuR. However, HuR complexes containing the GLUT1 mRNA can only be  isolated from the terminally differentiated adipocytes. Moreover, position  ,  Context: Human RNA-binding protein HuR, a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, is a  ubiquitously expressed member of the family of Hu proteins, which consist of two  N-terminal RNA recognition motifs (RRM1 and RRM2), a hinge region, and a  C-terminal RRM (RRM3). Although in vitro experiments showed indiscriminate  binding of Hu proteins synthesized in bacterial systems to many different  AU-rich elements (AREs), in vivo studies have pointed to a cytoplasmic role for  HuR protein in antagonizing the rapid decay of some specific ARE-containing  mRNAs, depending on physiological situations. By ectopically overexpressing HuR  and its mutant derivatives in NIH 3T3 cells to mimic HuR upregulation of specific ARE-containing mRNAs in other systems, we have examined the in vivo  ARE-binding specificity of HuR and dissected its functionally critical domains.  We show that in NIH 3T3 cells, HuR stabilizes reporter messages containing only the c-fos ARE and not other AREs. Two distinct binding sites were identified  within the c-fos ARE, the 5' AUUUA-containing domain and the 3'  U-stretch-containing domain. These actions of HuR are markedly different from  ,  Context: Tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) often have sustained expression of  labile genes, including angiogenic growth factors and immunosuppressive  cytokines, which promote tumor progression. Stabilization of the RNA transcripts  for these genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is an  important molecular pathway for this up-regulation. HuR, a member of the Elav  family of RNA-binding proteins, has been implicated in this pathway through its binding to adenine and uridine (AU)-rich stability elements (ARE) located in the  3' untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of the mRNA. Whereas three of the Elav family  members (Hel-N1, HuC, and HuD) are restricted to young and mature neurons, HuR is more broadly expressed, including proliferating cells of the developing CNS.  Because RNA stabilization of labile genes may promote tumor growth, we analyzed  and compared the expression pattern of HuR in 35 freshly resected and cultured  ","23223443, 19884656, 25422430, 16639702, 12242302, 11280780","HuR is an RNA-binding protein that can stabilize labile mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions and has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Through its post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation, senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli.","17392515, 15861128, 23508105, 22201738, 19345675, 23223443, 21816340, 22310293, 21745814, 19289500, 17288991, 23401122, 21164076, 23837869, 19252527, 9763509, 23155001, 14530362, 15543229, 11486028, 15863502, 10673359, 9628881, 16639702, 9155038, 10075998, 9860962, 20007147, 19884656, 15036402, 15824116, 21515253, 12605686, 24152440, 17317627, 22446588, 12242302, 12730239"
What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?,The DNA sequence is one of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning.," Context:  Recent studies of genome-wide nucleosomal organization suggest that the DNA  sequence is one of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning. Although  the search for underlying patterns encoded in nucleosomal DNA has been going on for about 30 years, our knowledge of these patterns still remains limited. Based  on our evaluations of DNA deformation energy, we developed new scoring functions  to predict nucleosome positioning. There are three principal differences between our approach and earlier studies: (i) we assume that the length of nucleosomal  DNA varies from 146 to 147 bp; (ii) we consider the anisotropic flexibility of  pyrimidine-purine (YR) dimeric steps in the context of their neighbors (e.g.,  ,  Context: Eukaryotic genomes are packed into chromatin, whose basic repeating unit is the  nucleosome. Nucleosome positioning is a widely researched area. A common  experimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of  micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase  in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the  resulting fragments. This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and  especially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. As a  consequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major  determinant of nucleosome positioning in vivo. More generally, our results show that data generated after MNase digestion of chromatin requires a matched  control experiment in order to determine nucleosome positions.  ,  Context: Eukaryotic genomes are packed into chromatin, whose basic repeating unit is the  nucleosome.

We present  r3Cseq, an R/Bioconductor package designed to perform 3C-seq data analysis in a  number of different experimental designs. The package reads a common aligned  read input format, provides data normalization, allows the visualization of  candidate interaction regions and detects statistically significant chromatin interactions, thus greatly facilitating hypothesis generation and the  interpretation of experimental results. We further demonstrate its use on a  series of real-world applications.

Which chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome?,The X chromosome contains the TLR7 locus in the human genome.," Context: Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is critical to the induction of antiviral immunity,  but TLR7 dosage is also a key pathogenic factor in systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE), an autoimmune disease with strong female bias. SLE prevalence is also  elevated in individuals with Klinefelter syndrome, who carry one or more  supernumerary X chromosomes, suggesting that the X chromosome complement  contributes to SLE susceptibility. TLR7 is encoded by an X chromosome locus, and we examined here whether the TLR7 gene evades silencing by X chromosome  inactivation in immune cells from women and Klinefelter syndrome males.  Single-cell analyses of TLR7 allelic expression demonstrated that substantial fractions of primary B lymphocytes, monocytes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells  not only in women but also in Klinefelter syndrome males express TLR7 on both X  chromosomes. Biallelic B lymphocytes from women displayed greater TLR7  ,  Context:  Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is critical to the induction of antiviral immunity,  but TLR7 dosage is also a key pathogenic factor in systemic lupus erythematosus  (SLE), an autoimmune disease with strong female bias.

We analysed TLR7 polymorphisms by  melting curve analysis and reconstructed haplotypes. The c.32A>T variation was  over-represented in female patients with chronic HCV-infection compared to  patients with other chronic liver diseases and to healthy controls (P < 0.05).  In contrast, c.2403 G>A was less prevalent in male patients with chronic  HCV-infection (P < 0.05). No association was observed for the third variant,  c.1-120T>G. Haplotype analysis confirmed the differential distribution of TLR7  variants between the groups. Within the group of female patients with chronic  HCV-infection, c.32T was predictive of an unfavourable outcome of interferon-alpha therapy (P < 0.05). This study reports the association of TLR7  variants with chronic HCV-infection and with the response to interferon-alpha  therapy in patients with chronic HCV-infection. Our results suggest that variations of TLR7 impair the immune response to HCV and imply a gender-specific  effect of this X-chromosomal variation.  ,  Context: An efficient immune response against hepatitis C virus (HCV) is necessary to  clear infection. As HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus, a role for TLR7 in the  immune response against HCV is possible, and early clinical studies have  demonstrated an antiviral effect of TLR7 stimulation. We tested the hypothesis  that genetic variations of TLR7 are associated with chronic HCV-infection and  outcome of therapy. The prevalence of three TLR7 variations was analysed in 978 patients with chronic HCV-infection, 898 patients with chronic liver disease of  other aetiologies, and in 203 healthy controls. The prevalence of TLR7  variations was correlated with the response to interferon-alpha-based treatment in 544 patients with chronic HCV-infection. We analysed TLR7 polymorphisms by  melting curve analysis and reconstructed haplotypes. The c.32A>T variation was  over-represented in female patients with chronic HCV-infection compared to  ,  Context: atopic disorders has previously been obtained. Xp22 harbours the TLR7 and TLR8  genes. METHODS: The involvement of TLR7 and TLR8 in the aetiology of asthma and related  disorders was investigated by a family based association analysis of two  independently ascertained family samples comprising 540 and 424 individuals from  135 and 100 families, respectively. Ten affected individuals from families  showing evidence of linkage to Xp22 were screened for sequence variations in  TLR7 and 8, and nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified were  tested for association. RESULTS: In both samples, significant associations were observed for single SNPs and haplotypes of both TLR7 and 8 in all four phenotypes investigated: asthma,  rhinitis, atopic dermatitis and increased specific IgE. The most significant  association was seen for rs2407992 (TLR8) in asthma (p = 0.00023, sample A and B combined, recessive model). In TLR7, rs179008 showed the strongest association.  Both rs179008 and rs2407992 are of putative functional significance, potentially  affecting TLR7 processing and TLR8 splicing, respectively. Haplotypes comprising  ,  Context: In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial.  Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous  lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes  SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted  TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic  cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes  single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each  cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome  inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been  hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female immune cells, hence fostering harmful autoreactive and inflammatory responses.  We review here the current knowledge of the role of TLR7 in SLE, and recent  evidence demonstrating that TLR7 escapes from X chromosome inactivation in pDCs,  ","29374079, 29374079, 18088248, 18088248, 18682521, 30276444",The TLR7 locus acts in vivo as a tumor suppressor gene and is located on chromosome X (X chromosome).,"27347137, 16777955, 18521959, 25339659, 21396113, 25541140, 16709748, 25650422, 18606711, 18682521, 30276444, 29374079"

RESULTS: In both cases, sympathectomy occurred at the level of the second order  neuron, but hydroxyamphetamine testing suggested at least partial third order  neuron involvement.  ,  Context:  A case of heterochromia iridis and Horner's syndrome is reported in a 7-year old  girl with paravertebral neurilemmoma. These clinical findings can be useful in  the early diagnosis of mediastinal tumors in the paravertebral axis. While typically associated with neuroblastoma, these findings can be due to tumors  which are inately benign--in this case neurilemmoma. The mechanism for  heterochromia is briefly discussed.  ,  Context: Waardenburg and congenital Horner syndromes are both recognized causes of  congenital hypochromic iris heterochromia. Each has been linked to disruptions  in the pathway of tyrosinase induction, thus leading to a deficiency in melanin  production of the iris. These syndromes must be considered in the differential  diagnosis of a patient presenting with heterochromia iridis. We present the case  of a 20-month old boy afflicted with both congenital Horner syndrome and Waardenburg syndrome, type II. In contrast to the more common presentation of  congenital Horner syndrome, the affected iris in this case was the darker of the  two because of the effects of the concomitant Waardenburg syndrome on the contralateral iris pigmentation. We are unaware of any other cases presenting  with both Horner and Waardenburg syndromes and believe that this case serves as  an excellent opportunity to briefly review the pathophysiology involved with  these disorders.  ,  Context: Waardenburg and congenital Horner syndromes are both recognized causes of  congenital hypochromic iris heterochromia.

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,No information is available about the effect of thyronamines on fat tissue.," Context: release by rat liver mitochondria. Hypothyroid animals were used because of the  low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to  reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The  observed changes could be explained by a partial block, operated by  thyronamines, at a site located near the site of action of antimycin A. This  hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that thyronamines reduced the  activity of Complex III where the site of antimycin action is located. Because  thyronamines exerted their effects at concentrations comparable to those found  in hepatic tissue, it is conceivable that they can affect in vivo mitochondrial O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2) production acting as modulators of thyroid hormone  action.  ,  Context:  A class of thyroid hormone metabolites has dramatic physiological effects on  metabolism and heart rate by still-unknown mechanisms of action. A recent study  has discovered that thyronamines can inhibit neuronal reuptake of neurotransmitters and prevent the intracellular transport of monoamines for  release. This discovery presents a third signaling pathway for thyroid hormone,  expands the role that thyroid plays in the central nervous system, and suggests mechanisms of action for the effects of thyronamine-derived neuromodulators.  ,  Context: Sulfotransferases (SULTs) catalyze the sulfation of many endogenous compounds  that include monoamine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine (DA), and thyroid  hormones (iodothyronines). Decarboxylation of iodothyronines results in  formation of thyronamines. In the mouse, thyronamines act rapidly in a  nongenomic fashion to initiate hypothermia and decrease cardiac output and heart  rate. These effects are attenuated after 1-4 h, and metabolism of thyronamines via sulfation may be a mechanism for termination of thyronamine action. We  carried out this study to test thyronamine (T0AM), 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM),  3,5-diiodothyronamine (T2AM), and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronamine (T3AM) as substrates for human liver and cDNA-expressed SULT activities. We characterized several  biochemical properties of SULTs using the thyronamines that acted as substrates  for SULT activities in a human liver high-speed supernatant pool (n=3). T1AM led  ,  Context: 100-fold lower dose administered centrally induced a more pronounced acute EGP  increase and hyperglucagonemia while plasma insulin tended to decrease. Both  systemic and central infusions of T(0)AM caused smaller increases in EGP, plasma  glucose, and glucagon compared with T(1)AM. Neither T(1)AM nor T(0)AM influenced  any of these parameters upon low dose i.v. administration. We conclude that  central administration of low-dose thyronamines suffices to induce the acute  alterations in glucoregulatory hormones and glucose metabolism following  systemic thyronamine infusion. Our data indicate that thyronamines can act  centrally to modulate glucose metabolism.  ,  Context: 100-fold lower dose administered centrally induced a more pronounced acute EGP  increase and hyperglucagonemia while plasma insulin tended to decrease.

Systemic administration of synthetic 3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM) and - to a  lesser extent - thyronamine (T(0)AM), leads to acute bradycardia, hypothermia,  decreased metabolic rate, and hyperglycemia. This profile led us to hypothesize  that the central nervous system is among the principal targets of thyronamines.  We investigated whether a low dose i.c.v. infusion of synthetic thyronamines  recapitulates the changes in glucose metabolism that occur following i.p.  thyronamine administration. Plasma glucose, glucoregulatory hormones, and  endogenous glucose production (EGP) using stable isotope dilution were monitored in rats before and 120 min after an i.p. (50 mg/kg) or i.c.v. (0.5 mg/kg) bolus  infusion of T(1)AM, T(0)AM, or vehicle. To identify the peripheral effects of  centrally administered thyronamines, drug-naive rats were also infused intravenously with low dose (0.5 mg/kg) thyronamines.

Which event results in the acetylation of S6K1?,Growth factor stimulation results in the acetylation of S6K1 at lysine 516.," Context: stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines. In addition to  phosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine  acetylation.

List the components of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2).,"The components of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2) are mTOR, Rictor, mLST8, Sin1, and Protor-1 or Protor-2."," Context:  The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is part of two distinct complexes,  mTORC1, containing raptor and mLST8, and mTORC2, containing rictor, mLST8 and  sin1. Although great endeavors have already been made to elucidate the function and regulation of mTOR, the cytoplasmic nuclear distribution of the mTOR  complexes is unknown. Upon establishment of the proper experimental conditions,  we found mTOR, mLST8, rictor and sin1 to be less abundant in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm of non-transformed, non-immortalized, diploid human primary  fibroblasts. Although raptor is also high abundant in the nucleus, the  mTOR/raptor complex is predominantly cytoplasmic, whereas the mTOR/rictor  ,  Context:  Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase and that forms  two multiprotein complexes known as the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex  2 (mTORC2). mTOR regulates cell growth, proliferation and survival. mTORC1 is composed of the mTOR catalytic subunit and three associated proteins: raptor,  mLST8/GβL and PRAS40. mTORC2 contains mTOR, rictor, mLST8/GβL, mSin1, and  protor. Here, we discuss mTOR as a promising anti-ischemic agent. It is believed that mTORC2 lies down-stream of Akt and acts as a direct activator of Akt. The  different functions of mTOR can be explained by the existence of two distinct  mTOR complexes containing unique interacting proteins. The loss of TSC2, which  ,  Context: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem genetic disorder with severe  neurologic manifestations, including epilepsy, autism, anxiety and attention  deficit hyperactivity disorder. TSC is caused by the loss of either the TSC1 or  TSC2 genes that normally regulate the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)  kinase. mTOR exists within two distinct complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and  mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Loss of either TSC gene leads to increased mTORC1 but decreased mTORC2 signaling. As the contribution of decreased mTORC2 signaling to  neural development and homeostasis has not been well studied, we generated a  conditional knockout (CKO) of Rictor, a key component of mTORC2. mTORC2 signaling is impaired in the brain, whereas mTORC1 signaling is unchanged.  Rictor CKO mice have small brains and bodies, normal lifespan and are fertile.  Cortical layering is normal, but neurons are smaller than those in control  ,  Context: The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein kinase is an important  regulator of cell growth. Two complexes of mTOR have been identified: complex 1,  consisting of mTOR-Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR)-mLST8 (termed  mTORC1), and complex 2, comprising mTOR-Rictor (rapamycininsensitive companion  of mTOR)-mLST8-Sin1 (termed mTORC2). mTORC1 phosphorylates the p70 ribosomal S6K  (S6 kinase) at its hydrophobic motif (Thr389), whereas mTORC2 phosphorylates PKB (protein kinase B) at its hydrophobic motif (Ser473). In the present study, we  report that widely expressed isoforms of unstudied proteins termed Protor-1  (protein observed with Rictor-1) and Protor-2 interact with Rictor and are components of mTORC2.

Both  complexes phosphorylate the hydrophobic motifs of AGC kinase family members:  mTORC1 phosphorylates S6K (S6 kinase), whereas mTORC2 regulates phosphorylation of Akt, PKCα (protein kinase Cα) and SGK1 (serum- and glucocorticoid-induced  protein kinase 1). To investigate the roles of the Protor isoforms, we generated  single as well as double Protor-1- and Protor-2-knockout mice and studied how activation of known mTORC2 substrates was affected. We observed that loss of  Protor-1 and/or Protor-2 did not affect the expression of the other mTORC2  components, nor their ability to assemble into an active complex.

Rapamycin negatively regulates the  formation of both mTOR complexes, but the molecular mechanism of its effects on  mTORC2 remained elusive. We describe that in primary cells short-term treatment with rapamycin triggers dephosphorylation of rictor and sin1 exclusively in the  cytoplasm, but does not affect mTORC2 assembly.

OBJECTIVE: To compare serum selenium (s-Se) values in patients with newly diagnosed autoimmune thyroid disease and controls from the Danish population. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: S-Se was measured in triplicate by a fluorimetric method. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with newly diagnosed Graves' disease (GD) (n = 97) or autoimmune overt hypothyroidism (AIH) (n = 96), euthyroid subjects with high  serum levels of thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) (TPO-Ab > 1500 U/ml,  n = 92) and random controls (n = 830). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Differences in s-Se values.  ,  Context: by nutritional supply. The thyroid gland is, however, largely independent from  dietary selenium intake and thyroid selenoproteins are preferentially expressed.  As a consequence, no explicit effects on thyroid hormone profiles are observed  in healthy individuals undergoing selenium supplementation. However, low  selenium status correlates with risk of goiter and multiple nodules in European  women. Some clinical studies have demonstrated that selenium-deficient patients  with autoimmune thyroid disease benefit from selenium supplementation, although  the data are conflicting and many parameters must still be defined. The baseline  selenium status of an individual could constitute the most important parameter modifying the outcome of selenium supplementation, which might primarily disrupt  self-amplifying cycles of the endocrine-immune system interface rectifying the  interaction of lymphocytes with thyroid autoantigens. Selenium deficiency is likely to constitute a risk factor for a feedforward derangement of the immune  system-thyroid interaction, while selenium supplementation appears to dampen the  self-amplifying nature of this derailed interaction.  ,  Context: INTRODUCTION: In areas with severe selenium deficiency higher incidence of  thyroiditis has been reported due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent  glutathione peroxidase enzyme within thyroid cells.

What is the rate of epimutations in C. elegans?,Epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes in C. elegans.," Context: transmitted transgenerationally through meiosis. Epigenetic alterations  (epimutations) could thus contribute to heritable variation within populations  and be subject to evolutionary processes such as natural selection and drift.  However, the rate at which epimutations arise and their typical persistence are  unknown, making it difficult to evaluate their potential for evolutionary  adaptation. Here, we perform a genome-wide study of epimutations in a metazoan  organism. We use experimental evolution to characterize the rate, spectrum and  stability of epimutations driven by small silencing RNAs in the model nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that epimutations arise spontaneously at a rate approximately 25 times greater than DNA sequence changes and typically have  short half-lives of two to three generations. Nevertheless, some epimutations  last at least ten generations.

In order to identify new DNA damage response genes,  we isolated in a forward genetic screen 14 new mutations conferring hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation. We present here our characterization of  lem-3, one of the genes identified in this screen. LEM-3 contains a LEM domain  and a GIY nuclease domain. We confirm that LEM-3 has DNase activity in vitro. lem-3(lf) mutants are hypersensitive to various types of DNA damage, including  ionizing radiation, UV-C light and crosslinking agents. Embryos from irradiated  lem-3 hermaphrodites displayed severe defects during cell division, including  ,  Context: Epigenetic regulation involves changes in gene expression independent of DNA  sequence variation that are inherited through cell division.

A low success rate was obtained for  evolutionarily recently duplicated genes. Analysis of the data suggests that  this is not due to conditional or low-level expression. The remaining  explanation is that most of the annotated genes in the recently duplicated  category are pseudogenes, a proportion corresponding to 20% of all of the  annotated C. elegans genes. Further support for this surprisingly high figure  was sought by comparing sequences for families of recently duplicated C. elegans  genes. Although only a preliminary analysis, clear evidence for a gene having  been recently inactivated by genetic drift was found for many genes in the recently duplicated category. At least 4% of the annotated C. elegans genes can  be recognized as pseudogenes simply from closer inspection of the sequence data.  Lessons learned in identifying pseudogenes in C. elegans could be of value in the annotation of the genomes of other species where, although there may be  fewer pseudogenes, they may be harder to detect.

Is calcium overload involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy?,"Yes, intracellular calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy."," Context:  BACKGROUND: Cardiac cell apoptosis is the initiating factor of cardiac  complications especially diabetic cardiomyopathy. Mitochondria are susceptible  to the damaging effects of elevated glucose condition. Calcium overload and oxidative insult are the two mutually non-exclusive phenomena suggested to cause  cardiac dysfunction. Here, we examined the effect of high-glucose induced  calcium overload in calpain-1 mediated cardiac apoptosis in an in vitro setting. METHODS: H9c2, rat ventricular myoblast cell line was treated with elevated  glucose condition and the cellular consequences were studied. Intracellular  calcium trafficking, ROS generation, calpain-1 activation and caspase-12 and  ,  Context: sympathetic nervous system and abnormalities in catecholamine metabolism have  been identified in diabetes; their involvement in the genesis of cardiac pump  failure as well as large and small vessel disease is likely. The membrane  defects as indicated by changes in both plasma membrane and glycocalyx in  diabetic cardiomyopathy appear to be complex and may involve alterations in the  metabolism of lipids and pyrimidine nucleotides. It seems that intracellular  calcium overload is intimately involved in the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy; however, a concentrated research effort is required to  understand the primary biochemical lesion in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction in diabetes. In the meantime, a heightened awareness on the part of  clinicians concerning the susceptibility of diabetic patients to cardiovascular  problems may help in reducing mortality and morbidity in the diabetic  population.  ,  Context:  Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a diabetic complication, which results in  myocardial dysfunction independent of other etiological factors. Abnormal  intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) homeostasis has been implicated in DCM and may precede clinical manifestation. Studies in cardiomyocytes have shown that  diabetes results in impaired [Ca(2+)](i) homeostasis due to altered sarcoplasmic  reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) and sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) activity. Importantly, altered calcium homeostasis may also be involved in  diabetes-associated endothelial dysfunction, including impaired  endothelium-dependent relaxation and a diminished capacity to generate nitric  ,  Context:  It has been suggested that the occurrence of an intracellular Ca2+ overload may  result in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy, which is associated with  depletion of high-energy phosphate stores and a derangement of ultrastructure and cardiac dysfunction. Accordingly, the effects of verapamil, a Ca2+  antagonist, on cardiac function, ultrastructure, and high-energy phosphate  stores in the myocardium were evaluated in rats made diabetic by an intravenous injection of streptozocin (65 mg/kg). Four weeks after the induction of  diabetes, the animals were treated with three doses (2, 4, or 8 mg.kg-1.day-1)  of verapamil for 4 wk until they were used for the measurement of different  ,  Context: SL Na(+)-dependent Ca2+ uptake, ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake and Ca(2+)-stimulated  ATPase activities were depressed in the diabetic heart. Likewise, SR  ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake activity in the diabetic heart was markedly decreased  in comparison to the control preparations. These defects in diabetic SL and SR  Ca(2+)-transport activities were prevented by treatment of diabetic animals with  insulin. The results from the alloxan-rat model of diabetes support the view  that membrane abnormalities with respect to Ca2+ handling may lead to the  occurrence of intracellular Ca2+ overload and the development of diabetic  cardiomyopathy.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Cardiac cell apoptosis is the initiating factor of cardiac  complications especially diabetic cardiomyopathy.

Which is the role of mediator in genome organization?,"Mediator regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to promoters, and high Mediator binding density defines super enhancers that regulate cell-identity genes and oncogenes."," Context:  CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a master organizer of genome spatial organization  and plays an important role in mediating extensive chromatin interactions.  Circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) is a high-throughput approach that allows genome-wide screening for unknown potential interaction partners. Using a  conserved CTCF binding site on the Bcl11b locus as bait, an interaction partner  at the Arhgap6 locus on a different chromosome was identified by 4C.

Recently, mechanisms underlying this  relationship have been uncovered. By defining the organizational hierarchy of  the genome, determining changes in chromatin organization associated with  changes in cell identity, and describing chromatin organization within the  context of linear genomic features (such as chromatin modifications and  transcription factor binding) and architectural proteins (including Cohesin,  CTCF, and Mediator), a new paradigm in genome biology was established wherein  genomes are organized around gene regulatory factors that govern cell identity. As such, chromatin organization plays a central role in establishing and  maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome  organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity.  ,  Context: The Mediator complex regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to  promoters.

More research on colistin  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in critically ill patients and preterm  infants is needed to guide adequate colistin dosing at the least toxicity.
