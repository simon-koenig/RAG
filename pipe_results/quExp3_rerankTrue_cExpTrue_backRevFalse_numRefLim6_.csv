What is the implication of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma?,"Histone lysine methylation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma. Defective control of the histone code, particularly at H3K9, contributes to the development of this disease. Restoration of expression of genes"," Context:  Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27)  demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for  H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH  medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases.  Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high  expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425  medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2,  ,  Context: remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  (EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in  medulloblastoma. Our data demonstrate that tumour-specific hypermethylation  affects only a subset of genes, and does not support the existence of a  concordant methylation phenotype in this disease. We conclude that epigenetic  TSG inactivation is a significant feature of medulloblastoma, and identify  RASSF1A, HIC1 and CASP8 as potentially critical genes in its pathogenesis. Furthermore, methylation observed in the normal cerebellum emphasises the  requirement for appropriate control tissues when assessing the  tumour-specificity of TSG hypermethylation.  ,  Context: remaining genes studied showed either low frequency methylation (p14(ARF),  p16(INK4a), RIZ1; <7% of cases), no evidence of methylation (p15(INK4b), TIMP3,  TP73, TSLC1), or comparable patterns of methylation in the normal cerebellum  (EDNRB), suggesting that their hypermethylation does not play a major role in  medulloblastoma.

We found focal amplifications of 15 known oncogenes and focal deletions of 20  known tumor suppressor genes (TSG), most not previously implicated in  medulloblastoma. Notably, we identified previously unknown amplifications and  homozygous deletions, including recurrent, mutually exclusive, highly focal  genetic events in genes targeting histone lysine methylation, particularly that  of histone 3, lysine 9 (H3K9).

What is the role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation?,"The role of STAG1/STAG2 proteins in differentiation is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that they share high sequence identity, encode mutually exclusive cohesin subunits and retain partially overlapping functions, suggesting a potential role in cell"," Context: Cohesin is a multi-protein complex that tethers sister chromatids during mitosis  and mediates DNA repair, genome compartmentalisation and regulation of gene  expression. Cohesin subunits frequently acquire cancer loss-of-function  alterations and act as tumour suppressors in several tumour types. This has led  to increased interest in cohesin as potential target in anti-cancer therapy.  Here we show that the loss-of-function of STAG2, a core component of cohesin and  an emerging tumour suppressor, leads to synthetic dependency of mutated cancer  cells on its paralog STAG1. STAG1 and STAG2 share high sequence identity, encode  mutually exclusive cohesin subunits and retain partially overlapping functions. We inhibited STAG1 and STAG2 in several cancer cell lines where the two genes  have variable mutation and copy number status.

What is the association between cell phone use and glioblastoma?,"The hazard ratio (HR) for glioblastoma was 1.1 (95% CI = 0.95-1.4), with >10-year latency HR = 1.3 (95% CI = 1.03"," Context:  Previous studies have shown a consistent association between long-term use of  mobile and cordless phones and glioma and acoustic neuroma, but not for  meningioma. When used these phones emit radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs) and the brain is the main target organ for the handheld phone. The  International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified in May, 2011  RF-EMF as a group 2B, i.e. a 'possible' human carcinogen. The aim of this study was to further explore the relationship between especially long-term (>10 years)  use of wireless phones and the development of malignant brain tumours. We  conducted a new case-control study of brain tumour cases of both genders aged  ,  Context: radiological images. Controls were matched for gender, age (+/-5 years) and  place of residence. They were randomly drawn from electoral rolls. Detailed  information was collected for all subjects during a computer-assisted  face-to-face interview. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the  odds ratio (OR) for an association between the use of cell phones and risk of  each type of cancer.  RESULTS: Regular cell phone use was not associated with an increased risk of  neuroma (OR=0,92; 95% confidence interval=[0.53-1.59]), meningioma (OR=0,74; 95%  confidence interval=[0.43-1.28]) or glioma (OR=1.15; 95% confidence interval=[0.65-2.05]). Although these results are not statistically significant,  a general tendency was observed for an increased risk of glioma among the  heaviest users: long-term users, heavy users, users with the largest numbers of  telephones. CONCLUSION: No significant increased risk for glioma, meningioma or neuroma was  observed among cell phone users participating in Interphone. The statistical  power of the study is limited, however.

Although these results are not statistically significant,  a general tendency was observed for an increased risk of glioma among the  heaviest users: long-term users, heavy users, users with the largest numbers of  telephones.  CONCLUSION: No significant increased risk for glioma, meningioma or neuroma was  observed among cell phone users participating in Interphone. The statistical  power of the study is limited, however. Our results, suggesting the possibility of an increased risk among the heaviest users, therefore need to be verified in  the international INTERPHONE analyses.  ,  Context: BACKGROUND: Use of cell phones has increased dramatically since 1992 when they  were first introduced in France. Certain electromagnetic fields (at extremely  low frequency) have been recognized as possibly carcinogenic by the  International Agency for Research on Cancer. Given the use of radiofrequency  technology in cell phones, the rapid increase in the number of cell phones has  generated concerns about the existence of a potential health hazard. To evaluate  the relationship between the use of cell phones and the development of tumors of  the head, a multicentric international study (INTERPHONE), coordinated by the  International Agency for Research on Cancer, was carried out in 13 countries. This publication reports the results of the French part of the INTERPHONE study. METHODS: INTERPHONE is a case-control study focused on tumors of the brain and  central nervous system: gliomas, meningiomas and neuromas of cranial nerves. Eligible cases were men and women, residents of Paris or Lyon, aged 30-59, newly  diagnosed with a first primary tumor between February 2001 and August 2003. The  diagnoses were all either histologically confirmed or based upon unequivocal  ,  Context: categorised the radiofrequency electromagnetic fields from mobile phones, and  from other devices that emit similar non-ionising electromagnetic fields  (RF-EMF), as Group 2B, i.e., a 'possible', human carcinogen. The decision on  mobile phones was based mainly on the Hardell group of studies from Sweden and  the IARC Interphone study. We give an overview of current epidemiological  evidence for an increased risk for brain tumours including a meta-analysis of  the Hardell group and Interphone results for mobile phone use. Results for  cordless phones are lacking in Interphone. The meta-analysis gave for glioma in  the most exposed part of the brain, the temporal lobe, odds ratio (OR)=1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.04-2.81 in the ≥10 years (>10 years in the Hardell  group) latency group. Ipsilateral mobile phone use ≥1640h in total gave OR=2.29,  95% CI=1.56-3.37. The results for meningioma were OR=1.25, 95% CI=0.31-4.98 and OR=1.35, 95% CI=0.81-2.23, respectively. Regarding acoustic neuroma ipsilateral  mobile phone use in the latency group ≥10 years gave OR=1.81, 95% CI=0.73-4.45.  For ipsilateral cumulative use ≥1640h OR=2.55, 95% CI=1.50-4.40 was obtained.  ,  Context: gave a hazard ratio (HR) = 1.1 (95% confidence interval, CI = 0.9-1.2), with >  10-year latency HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 1.002-1.5, p trend = 0.02). For astrocytoma  grade I-II (low-grade), the results were, HR = 0.5 (95% CI = 0.3-0.9) and for  astrocytoma grade IV (glioblastoma), HR = 1.1 (95% CI = 0.95-1.4), with > 10  year latency HR = 1.3 (95% CI = 1.03-1.7). In the highest tertile (> 426 h) of  cumulative use, HR = 1.2 (95% CI = 0.95-1.5) was found for glioblastoma. The  results were similar for mobile and cordless phones. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased survival of glioma cases with long-term and high  cumulative use of wireless phones was found. A survival disadvantage for astrocytoma grade IV, but a survival benefit for astrocytoma grade I-II was  observed which could be due to exposure-related tumour symptoms leading to  earlier diagnosis and surgery in that patient group.

To provide examples, we describe the construction of  tight mutants of the replication factors Dpb11 and Mcm10, dpb11-iAID, and  mcm10-iAID. Because Dpb11 and Mcm10 are required for the initiation of DNA  replication, their tight mutants are unable to enter S phase. This is the case  for dpb11-iAID and mcm10-iAID cells after the addition of tetracycline and  auxin. Both the 'Tet-OFF' promoter and the AID system have been shown to work in model eukaryotes other than budding yeast.

Does the Oncotype DX test work with paraffin embedded tissues?,"Yes, the Oncotype DX test works with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks."," Context: the highest possibility for cure. Tumor grade is important in that it is  predictive of risk over time, but lacks standardization. Adjuvant! Online, a  web-based algorithm, is also used to guide treatment decisions. Recently, the  urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor  type 1 (PAI-1) biomarkers have been used to determine disease risk and,  consequently, determine whether or not chemotherapy is needed. However, the  assay requires a fresh-frozen tissue sample, which is not always feasible. The  oncotype DX® genomic assay has also been used to help prognosis estimation and  treatment decisions. It is currently under evaluation in conjunction with the uPA/PAI-1 assay in the Plan B trial. The question that remains in adjuvant  chemotherapy today for patients with node-negative disease is proper patient  selection. Node-negative breast cancer does not automatically suggest a good prognosis, or the preclusion of chemotherapy benefits, and additional biomarkers  are needed to help identify patients who do benefit from chemotherapy.  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: The Oncotype DX Colon Cancer Assay is a new diagnostic test for  determining the likelihood of recurrence in stage II colon cancer patients after  surgical resection using fixed paraffin embedded (FPE) primary colon tumor tissue. Like the Oncotype DX Breast Cancer Assay, this is a high complexity,  multi-analyte, reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay  that measures the expression levels of specific cancer-related genes. By capturing the biology underlying each patient's tumor, the Oncotype DX Colon  Cancer Assay provides a Recurrence Score (RS) that reflects an individualized  risk of disease recurrence. Here we describe its analytical performance using  ,  Context: Recently, recommendations for the use of the Oncotype DX assay in estrogen  receptor-positive node-negative breast cancer patients were incorporated into  guidelines from both the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the National  Comprehensive Cancer Network. The Oncotype DX assay is a diagnostic test which  measures changes in a set of 21 genes in order to predict the likelihood of  disease recurrence and also to predict which patients are most likely to respond  to chemotherapy. Oncotype DX has been available commercially since January 2004  and has been used for more than 85,000 patients. Drs. William J. Gradishar, Nora  M. Hansen, and Barbara Susnik answered questions regarding the incorporation of the Oncotype DX breast cancer assay into routine clinical practice. This expert  dialog offers an update and clinical insights into when, how, and why clinicians  might incorporate the Oncotype DX assay into the management of their breast cancer patients. Also, the latest research into the benefit of the Oncotype DX  assay in node-positive patients is discussed. Finally, sample case studies offer  clinically relevant examples of the practical application of the Oncotype DX  assay.  ,  Context: breast cancers in Ontario (according to 2007 data). Currently it is estimated  that only 15% of these women will develop a distant metastasis at 10 years;  however, a far great proportion currently receive adjuvant chemotherapy,  suggesting that more women are being treated with chemotherapy than can benefit.  There is therefore a need to develop better prognostic and predictive tools to  improve the selection of women that may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.  TECHNOLOGY OF CONCERN: The Oncotype-DX Breast Cancer Assay (Genomic Health,  Redwood City, CA) quantifies gene expression for 21 genes in breast cancer  tissue by performing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks that are obtained during  initial surgery (lumpectomy, mastectomy, or core biopsy) of women with early  breast cancer that is newly diagnosed.

Which disease of the central nervous system is characterized by the presence of Lewy bodies?,"Lewy body disease, which associates dementia, parkinsonian features, dysautonomia, and motor neuron disease."," Context:  Parkinson's disease (PD) and related Lewy body diseases are characterized by  deposition of α-synuclein aggregates in both the central nervous system and  peripheral nervous system. Synucleinopathy lesions spread to larger brain areas as the disease progresses, and prion-like cell-to-cell transmission of  aggregated α-synuclein is thought to be the underlying mechanism for this  pathological spreading. LRRK2 is another protein linked to the pathogenesis of PD, and its presence in Lewy bodies has attracted much attention as to whether  LRRK2 and α-synuclein interplay during the pathogenesis of PD. However, the  relationship between these two crucial proteins still remains unclear. In this  ,  Context: Lewy bodies are intraneuronal inclusions initially found in the pigmented  brainstem nuclei of patients with Parkinson's disease. Their aspect varies  according to their neuronal or cerebral situation. They have been a long time  the hallmark of Parkinson's disease, but in recent years it has emerged that a  small group of rare disorders or rare variants of common degenerative diseases  are also sometimes associated with Lewy bodies in the nervous system.  Pathological studies have also individualized a new disorder characterized by  the presence of numerous Lewy bodies throughout the cerebral cortex and the  brainstem: Lewy body disease. The clinical syndrome associates dementia, parkinsonian features, dysautonomia and motor neuron disease. The dementia is  cortical in type and psychiatric symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations or  delusions are frequent.

Their aspect varies  according to their neuronal or cerebral situation. They have been a long time  the hallmark of Parkinson's disease, but in recent years it has emerged that a  small group of rare disorders or rare variants of common degenerative diseases  are also sometimes associated with Lewy bodies in the nervous system.

The origin of this disorder remains  unclear, but it could be a primitive abnormality of neuronal cytoskeleton.  ,  Context: Autonomic failure with Lewy bodies (AF-LB) was first described by Fichefet et  al. in 1965, and more than ten cases have been reported to date. AF-LB and  Parkinson's disease (PD) share the neuropathological findings characterized by  widely distributed Lewy bodies in the central nervous system including the  substantia nigra and locus coeruleus. However, clinical manifestations of AF-LB  are far different from PD in which autonomic dysfunction, if present, is not a predominant feature. In the present study, clinical features were comparatively  analysed in AF-LB and PD to investigate the nosological relation between PD and  AF-LB. The subjects were 94 patients with PD and 11 reported cases of AF-LB in the literature. A test of 70 degrees passive head-up tilt was performed upon the  patients with PD in our laboratory.

Clinically, DLB is distinguished from AD by fluctuating cognition, prominent visual hallucinations and parkinsonism,  and from Parkinson disease, by the appearance of parkinsonism within one year of  cognitive or behavioral decline. The main component of Lewy bodies is alpha-synuclein. Accumulating evidence suggests that its aggregation constitutes  one of the first steps preceding Lewy body formation, so that antiaggregation  strategies would be very useful to prevent alpha-synuclein fibril formation.

The NoSAS Score can be used for screening of which disorders?,The NoSAS score can be used for screening Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) and Obstructive Sleep Apnea Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS). It has a good degree of differentiation for SDB and is effective in screening," Context: RESULTS: A total of 450 patients were included in the study. The sensitivity,  specificity, PPV, and NPV of the NoSAS score were 81%, 51.2%, 88.2%, and 37.5%  for an AHI (apnea–hypopnea index) ≥ 5 event/h and 84.5%, 38.2%, 66%, and 63.4%  for an AHI ≥ 15 event/h, respectively. AUC percentages for the NoSAS score,  STOP-Bang questionnaire, Berlin questionnaire, and ESS were 0.740, 0.737, 0.626,  and 0.571 for an AHI ≥ 5 events/h and 0.715, 0.704, 0.574, and 0.621 for an AHI  ≥ 30 events/h. The NoSAS score had a false negative rate of 2.9% for severe SDB. CONCLUSION: The NoSAS score had a good degree of differentiation for SDB and can  be used as an easily applicable, subjective, and effective screening tool in a sleep clinical population in Turkey. Not only in moderate to severe SDB but also  in mild SDB, the NoSAS score performed better than the other 3 screening tools.  ,  Context: metabolomic analysis by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and  lipidomic analysis with liquid chromatography followed by detection by MALDI-MS.  This study included 37 patients with OSA and 16 controls. From the 6 metabolites  and 22 lipids initially selected, those with the best association with OSA were  glutamic acid, deoxy sugar and arachidonic acid (metabolites), and  glycerophosphoethanolamines, sphingomyelin and lyso-phosphocholines (lipids).  For the questionnaires, the NoSAS score performed best with screening for OSA  (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.724, p = 0.003). The combination of the NoSAS  score with metabolites or lipids resulted in an AUC for detecting OSA of 0.911 and 0.951, respectively. In conclusion, metabolomic and lipidomic strategies  suggested potential early biomarkers in OSA that could also be helpful in  screening for this sleep disorder beyond traditional questionnaires.  ,  Context: All patients were measured for their height, weight, neck circumference and  other parameters. NoSAS scores, improved Mallampati grading and polysomnography  （PSG） were performed in these patients. According to AHI in PSG monitoring  results, patients were divided into non-osa group （AHI<5） 93 cases and OSA group  251 cases. The OSA group were divided into mild （AHI 5-15）, moderate（AHI 16-30）  and severe OSA group（AHI>30） according to the PSG result. The ROC curve was  plotted to evaluate the screening value of NoSAS and improved Mallampati grading  combined with NoSAS for OSA. Result:With the NoSAS score of 8 or 9 as cutoffs  for analysis, the sensitivity for OSA was 0.733 and 0.701; the specificity for OSA was 0.538 and 0.624, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of NoSAS  combined with improved Mallampati grading for screening OSA were 0.813 and  0.710, respectively. Conclusion:As a new screening tool, NoSAS questionnaire is simple and convenient, and has certain screening value to OSA.

Not only in moderate to severe SDB but also  in mild SDB, the NoSAS score performed better than the other 3 screening tools.  ,  Context: NoSAS score and the SBQ questionnaire had a higher accuracy than the other 3  questionnaires as screening questionnaires for diagnosing OSAHS, and the value  of DOR were 4.298 and 3.758 respectively. Conclusions: The NoSAS score and the  SBQ questionnaire have a moderate performance in diagnosing OSAHS. The NoSAS  score is a new screening tool, and it is similar to the SBQ questionnaire, being  also simple and effective. While the SBQ questionnaire is more widely used, it  is necessary to further evaluate the diagnostic value of NoSAS score.  ,  Context: results, patients were divided into non-osa group （AHI<5） 93 cases and OSA group  251 cases.

This technique allows for near real-time,  multiplexed analysis at levels of detection that exceed many of the conventional  ,  Context:  Marine pufferfish contain tetrodotoxin (TTX), an extremely potent neurotoxin.  All species of the genus Takifugu accumulate TTX in the liver and ovaries,  although the tissue(s) in which it is localized can differ among species. TTX is the major defense strategy the pufferfish appears to use against predators. TTX  is also used as a male-attracting pheromone during spawning. Here we demonstrate  an additional (and unexpected) use of maternal TTX in the early larval stages of the Takifugu pufferfish. Predation experiments demonstrated that juveniles of  all the species of fish used as predators ingested pufferfish larvae, but spat  them out promptly. Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MSMS)  ,  Context:  Puffer fish, Takifugu niphobles, collected from the Hong Kong coastal waters  were screened for tetrodotoxin-producing bacteria. A Gram-negative,  non-acid-fast, non-sporing and rod shaped bacterial strain (designated as gutB01) was isolated from the intestine of the puffer fish and was shown to  produce tetrodotoxin (TTX). Based on the Microbial Identification (MIDI) and  16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) phylogenetic analysis, the strain was identified as Raoultella terrigena. The TTX production ability of the strain  was confirmed by mouse bioassay, ELISA and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Our  results reiterate that the TTX found in puffer fish was likely produced by the  ,  Context: species found previously in 1992-1993. Conventional mouse bioassay was used to  determine the toxicity in all fish tissue extracts, i.e., liver, reproductive  tissue, digestive tissue and muscle. One of each of the species L. lunaris and  L. spadiceus (5.56 and 0.93%, respectively) were toxic. All 28 T. nigroviridis  and 2 A. reticularis (100%) from the Andaman seas were toxic. The toxicity  scores in T. nigroviridis tissues were much higher than in the respective  tissues of the other three fish species. Liquid chromatography/tandem mass  spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed that the main toxic principle was tetrodotoxin  (TTX). This study is the first to report TTX in L. spadiceus. Our findings raised a concern for people, not only Thais but also inhabitants of other  countries situated on the Andaman coast; consuming puffers of the Andaman seas  is risky due to potential TTX intoxication.  ,  Context:  Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a highly potent neurotoxin that blocks the action  potential by selectively binding to voltage-gated sodium channels (Na(v)). The  skeletal muscle Na(v) (Na(v)1.4) channels in most pufferfish species and certain North American garter snakes are resistant to TTX, whereas in most mammals they  are TTX-sensitive. It still remains unclear as to whether the difference in this  sensitivity among the various vertebrate species can be associated with adaptive evolution. In this study, we investigated the adaptive evolution of the  vertebrate Na(v)1.4 channels. By means of the CODEML program of the PAML 4.3  package, the lineages of both garter snakes and pufferfishes were denoted to be  ","20411115, 20411115, 24279996, 22163191, 22069694, 21734837","Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a low molecular weight (approximately 319 Da) neurotoxin found in a number of animal species, including pufferfish.

Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?,"No, a selective sweep can reduce genetic variation across a region of more than 50 kbp, as seen in Drosophila melanogaster."," Context:  Antagonistic host-parasite interactions can drive rapid adaptive evolution in  genes of the immune system, and such arms races may be an important force  shaping polymorphism in the genome. The RNA interference pathway gene Argonaute-2 (AGO2) is a key component of antiviral defense in Drosophila, and we  have previously shown that genes in this pathway experience unusually high rates  of adaptive substitution. Here we study patterns of genetic variation in a 100-kbp region around AGO2 in three different species of Drosophila. Our data  suggest that recent independent selective sweeps in AGO2 have reduced genetic  variation across a region of more than 50 kbp in Drosophila melanogaster, D.  ,  Context: families were grouped by their consensus position and designated by their  proximity to one of the three origins (O1, O2, O3). Conserved orthologs were  concentrated near the origins and most variation in genome content occurred  distant from the origins. Linear regressions of both synonymous and  nonsynonymous substitution rates on distance from replication origins were  significantly positive, the rates being greatest in the region furthest from any  of the origins and slowest among genes near the origins. Genes near O1 also  evolved faster than those near O2 and O3, which suggest that this origin may  fire later in the cell cycle. Increased evolutionary rates and gene dispensability are strongly associated with reduced gene expression caused in  part by reduced gene dosage during the cell cycle. Therefore, in this genus of  Archaea as well as in many Bacteria, evolutionary rates and variation in genome content associate with replication timing.  ,  Context: families were grouped by their consensus position and designated by their  proximity to one of the three origins (O1, O2, O3).

Our analysis of 4,227 such genes uncovers surprisingly high  genetic variation across human populations. This increased diversity is unlikely to reflect relaxed purifying selection. Remarkably, MAE genes exhibit an  elevated recombination rate and an increased density of hypermutable sequence  contexts. However, these factors do not fully account for the increased diversity. We find that the elevated nucleotide diversity of MAE genes is also  associated with greater allelic age: variants in these genes tend to be older  and are enriched in polymorphisms shared by Neanderthals and chimpanzees. Both  ,  Context: with low levels of recombination, selection at other loci severely reduces the  effective population size and genetic variance in fitness at a focal locus (the  Hill-Robertson effect), making a population less able to respond to selection  and to rid itself of deleterious mutations. Sex and recombination reveal the  hidden genetic variance in fitness by combining chromosomes of intermediate  fitness to create chromosomes that are relatively free of (or are loaded with)  deleterious mutations. This increase in genetic variance within finite  populations improves the response to selection and generates a substantial  advantage to sex and recombination that is fairly insensitive to the form of epistatic interactions between deleterious alleles. The mechanism supported by  our results offers a robust and broadly applicable explanation for the  evolutionary advantage of recombination and can explain the spread of costly  sex.  ,  Context: higher than the nucleotide diversity for the chiffchaff (pi values of 0.0025,  0.0017 and 0.0139). In willow warblers, Tajima's D analyses showed that the  mtDNA diversity, but not the nuclear DNA diversity, has been reduced relative to  the neutral expectation of molecular evolution, suggesting the action of a  selective sweep affecting the maternally inherited genes. The large nuclear  diversity seen within willow warblers is not compatible with processes of  neutral evolution occurring in a population with a constant population size,  unless the long-term effective population size has been very large (N(e) >  10(6)). We suggest that the contrasting patterns of genetic diversity in the willow warbler may reflect a more complex evolutionary history, possibly  including historical demographic fluctuations or historical male-biased  introgression of nuclear genes from a differentiated population of Phylloscopus  warblers.

QC caused a dose-dependent reduction in cell viability in all three  cell lines. However, the parental cells were more susceptible to QC-mediated  cell death, suggesting that p53- and p21-dependent processes were involved.  QC-mediated cell death was measured with the following endpoints: the Bax/Bcl-xL  ratio, cleaved PARP, apoptotic nuclei visualized by DAPI staining, and COMET  formation. In addition, markers of autophagy were measured. Acridine orange  staining revealed increased accumulation of autophagic vacuoles (AVs) after QC treatment in a dose-dependent manner in parental cells, and decreased staining  in isogenic HCT-116 p53-/- and HCT-116 p21-/- cells. Immunofluorescence of LC3B  was significantly lowered in QC-treated cells lacking p53 or p21, compared to the parental cells.

Apoptotic photoreceptors were  identified as rods and resulted from pathological phototransduction signaling.  This wave of early apoptosis triggered Bcl-2-related pathway and Bax apoptotic  activity, while activation of the caspases was not induced. Following cellular  stress, multiple signaling pathways are initiated which either commit cells to  death or trigger pro-survival responses including autophagy. We report that  Bcl-2-related early rod apoptosis was associated with the upregulation of  autophagy markers including chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) substrate receptor LAMP-2 and lysosomal hydrolases Cathepsin S and Lysozyme. This suggests  that lysosomal-mediated autophagy may be triggered in response to early rod  apoptosis in Rpe65-LCA disease. These results highlight that Rpe65-related primary stress induces early signaling events, which trigger  Bax-induced-apoptotic pathway and autophagy-mediated cellular response. These  events may determine retinal cell fate, progression and severity of the disease.  ,  Context: Autophagy is important in cellular homeostasis for the cell survival mechanism.  Deficiency or excess of autophagy is generally related to some of diseases such  as cancer and neurodegeneration.

Can a circRNA be translated into protein?,"Yes, some circRNAs can be effectively translated into detectable peptides through internal Ribosome Entry site (IRES)- and N6-methyladenosines (m6A)-mediated cap-independent translation initiation."," Context: myogenesis and altered in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. A high-content functional  genomic screen allowed the study of their functional role in muscle  differentiation. One of them, circ-ZNF609, resulted in specifically controlling  myoblast proliferation. Circ-ZNF609 contains an open reading frame spanning from  the start codon, in common with the linear transcript, and terminating at an  in-frame STOP codon, created upon circularization. Circ-ZNF609 is associated  with heavy polysomes, and it is translated into a protein in a  splicing-dependent and cap-independent manner, providing an example of a  protein-coding circRNA in eukaryotes.  ,  Context: SUMMARY: Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of endogenous RNAs, are  widespread in eukaryotic cells. Emerging roles in diverse biological processes  suggest that circRNA is a promising key player in RNA world. Most circRNAs are  generated through back-splicing of pre-mRNAs, forming a covalently closed loop  structure with no 5' caps or 3' polyadenylated tails. In addition, most circRNAs  were not associated with translating ribosomes, therefore, circRNAs were deemed  to be noncoding. However, the latest research findings revealed that some  circRNAs could generate proteins in vivo, which expands the landscape of  transcriptome and proteome. To gain insights into the new area of circRNA translation, we introduce an integrated tool capable of detecting circRNAs with  protein-coding potential from high-throughput sequencing data.

"There is no drug available to prevent HIV infection, Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), yes or no?","No, there are drugs available for PrEP, specifically antiretroviral medications such as Truvada, which acts by inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcriptase."," Context:  Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an experimental approach to HIV prevention  and consists of antiretroviral drugs to be taken before potential HIV exposure  in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection and continued during periods of risk. An effective PrEP could provide an additional safety net to sexually  active persons at risk, when combined with other prevention strategies.

Two antiretroviral nucleoside analog HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor  drugs are currently under trial as PrEP drugs, namely  ,  Context:  HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the use of one or more antiretroviral  medications (in combination) to prevent HIV infection. The most commonly used  PrEP medication (Truvada® , Gilead Sciences, Inc.) acts by inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. If someone who is using PrEP unknowingly becomes HIV  infected (termed 'PrEP breakthrough infection'), there may be suppressed viral  replication resulting in a virus level undetectable by the most sensitive HIV NAT.

Does oncogene-induced DNA replication stress inhibit genomic instability?,"No, oncogene-induced DNA replication stress is thought to drive genomic instability in cancer.

Here, we sequenced the exomes of 24,  mostly precancerous, colon polyps. Analysis of the sequences revealed mutations  in the APC, CTNNB1, and BRAF genes as the presumptive cancer-initiating events  and many passenger SNSs. We used the number of SNSs in the various lesions to  calculate mutation rates for normal colon and adenomas and found that colon  adenomas exhibit a mutator phenotype. Interestingly, the SNSs in the adenomas  mapped more often than expected within very large genes, where focal deletions  in response to DNA replication stress also map. We propose that single-stranded  DNA generated in response to oncogene-induced replication stress compromises the repair of deaminated cytosines and other damaged bases, leading to the observed  SNS mutator phenotype.  ,  Context:  Origin licensing builds a fundamental basis for genome stability in DNA  replication. Recent studies reported that deregulation of origin licensing is  associated with replication stress in precancerous lesions. The heterohexameric complex of minichromosome maintenance proteins (MCM2-7 complex) plays an  essential role in origin licensing. Previously, we reported the recovery of the  first viable Mcm mutant allele (named Mcm4(Chaos3)) in mice. The Mcm4(Chaos3) allele destabilizes the MCM2-7 complex, leading to chromosome instability and  the formation of spontaneous tumors in Mcm4(Chaos3) homozygous mice. Supporting  our finding, a recent study reported that mice with reduced expression of MCM2  ,  Context: However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and  it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication  program on a genomic scale. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic  approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in  regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells. We find  that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation  throughout the genome. Instead, depletion of PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1  results in the accumulation of DNA damage and an ATR-dependent cell cycle  arrest. Coincident with the ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest, we find increased DNA damage that is specifically limited to late replicating regions of the  Drosophila genome, suggesting that PR-Set7-mediated monomethylation of H4K20 is  critical for maintaining the genomic integrity of late replicating domains.  ,  Context: creating two bi-directional replication forks and initiating DNA replication. As  replication forks move along chromatin DNA, they frequently stall due to the  presence of a great number of replication barriers on chromatin DNA, such as  secondary DNA structures, protein/DNA complexes, DNA lesions, gene  transcription. Stalled forks must require checkpoint regulation for their  stabilization. Otherwise, stalled forks will collapse, which results in  incomplete DNA replication and genomic instability. This short review gives a  concise introduction regarding the current understanding of replication  initiation and replication fork stabilization.

List symptoms of the Hakim Triad?,"Cognitive disorder, gait disturbance, and urinary urgency."," Context:  INTRODUCTION: Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a chronic neurological  disorder characterized by enlarged ventricles and a triad of clinical symptoms  affecting gait, cognition, and urinary continence. Salomón Hakim first identified the syndrome in 1957 at the Hospital San Juan de Dios in Bogotá,  Colombia. Even after decades of international focus and thousands of  publications on his disorder, Hakim's story remains largely untold. METHODS: In this historical review, we explore the discovery of NPH through a  series of personal interviews with Professor Hakim and his family, discussions  with former colleagues, and review of the relevant medical literature.  ,  Context: Gaucher's disease is a rare inherited inborn error of metabolism caused by  mutations in the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase, GBA.  Glucocerebrosidase is involved in the metabolism of the lipid metabolism-derived  substrate, glucocerebroside. Accumulation of glucocerebroside substrate in  macrophages, as a result of loss of enzyme function, leads to the formation of  Gaucher cells causing hypertrophy of the spleen and liver, hematological  disorders, skeletal malformations and the neurological symptoms characteristic  of Gaucher's disease. The disease is subdivided into three types that differ in  their symptoms, severity and prognosis. Patients of any age can be affected but those of a younger age have a poor prognosis often dying in infancy. As a  genetic disorder the incidence of the disease is variable on a global scale.  Enzyme replacement therapy is the therapy of choice and has demonstrated good efficacy in treating the visceral and skeletal symptoms of Gaucher's disease.

It may be of  idiopathic aetiology or caused by demonstrable ipsilateral damage to the  sympathetic nervous system. A case is described where a patient presented to her  general dental practitioner complaining of distinctly demarcated unilateral  facial flushing and sweating. Onward referral resulted in a diagnosis of  Harlequin syndrome. CPD/CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This article highlights the  neurological signs and symptoms of Harlequin syndrome, making it easier to  recognize if it presents in general dental practice.  ,  Context: The deletion of chromosome 22q11.2 is involved in the majority of DiGeorge or  velo-cardiofacial syndrome. The phenotypic variability was noted in the ""CATCH  22"" acronym. This acronym doesn't recapitulate the full spectrum of the  symptoms. The diagnosis of this syndrome can be done with the prenatal  diagnosis, with fetal pathology or with a child alive. METHODS: Review of 52 cases with the microdeletion 22q11. Six cases were diagnosed during the prenatal period, 12 cases at fetal pathology examination,  and 34 cases during infancy. RESULTS: Cardiac malformations were the major indications (75%) to search for the microdeletion. The facial dysmorphy was difficult to diagnose during the  antenatal period or in dead foetus, thereby it was not often recognized. The  renal anomalies usually present in 35% of cases, were diagnosed in only 6 to 16%  ,  Context: normal pressure hydrocephalus (cognitive disorder, gait disturbance, and urinary  urgency: Hakim's triad) because of obstructive hydrocephalus caused by a DVA  located in the aqueduct. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) was performed to  relieve his symptoms, and the opening pressure of the lateral ventricle was  recorded to be 10 cm-H2O. Endoscopic examination of the intraventricular system  clearly revealed a vein within the aqueduct converging with the adjacent  subependymal vessels. These findings were compatible with the characteristics of  DVAs. His symptoms improved after the ETV. This case suggested that DVAs within  the aqueduct, despite of their congenital nature, could give rise to decompensated obstructive hydrocephalus even in elderly patients, resulting in  Hakim's triad.

The messenger RNA levels for MHC alpha and SERCA2 were markedly down-regulated, MHC  beta messenger RNA was up-regulated. Although T3 levels were normal in these  animals, this pattern of cardiac gene expression mimics a hypothyroid phenotype. Cardiac muscle contraction was significantly prolonged in papillary muscles from  transgenic mice. The electrocardiogram of transgenic mice showed a substantial  prolongation of the QRS interval.

What is the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19?,"MIS-C is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19, initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after exposure to the COVID-19. It's a disorder in which inflammation could occur in different parts of the"," Context: With the continuation of the second wave of a novel coronavirus disease  (COVID-19), which is likely to be even more devastating, there are several  associated health problems. COVID-19 is usually mild and non-fatal in children.  However, in rare cases, children could severely be affected, and clinical  manifestations may differ from adults. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in  children (MIS-C) is a rare but serious complication associated with COVID-19, initiated by an overactive immune response in kids that usually hits weeks after  exposure to the COVID-19. MIS-C is a disorder in which inflammation could occur  in different parts of the body. The disease puts pressure on the heart, as blood vessels leading towards the heart get inflamed and incapable of carrying  adequate blood, hence producing cardiac complications in children hospitalised  with MIS-C. The problem seems to be associated with COVID-19 in children;  ,  Context:  BACKGROUND: : Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated  with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging condition that was first  identified in paediatrics at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The condition is also known as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally  associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (PIMS-TS or  PIMS), and multiple definitions have been established for this condition that share overlapping features with Kawasaki Disease and toxic shock syndrome. METHODS: : A review was conducted to identify literature describing the  epidemiology of MIS-C, published up until March 9, 2021. A database established  ,  Context: disease (KD)-like hyperinflammatory illness have been reported in Europe and the  United States during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic with or without shock and  cardiac dysfunction. These patients tested positive for the polymerase chain  reaction or antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 or had a history of recent exposure to  COVID-19. Clinicians managing such patients coined new terms for this new  illness, such as COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory response syndrome,  pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19,  or COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).  The pathogenesis of MIS-C is unclear; however, it appears similar to that of cytokine storm syndrome. MIS-C shows clinical features similar to KD, but  differences between them exist with respect to age, sex, and racial  distributions and proportions of patients with shock or cardiac dysfunction.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review article is to provide a summary of the diagnosis and management of MIS-C with a focus on management in the acute care  setting. DISCUSSION: MIS-C is an inflammatory syndrome which can affect nearly any organ  system. The most common symptoms are fever and gastrointestinal symptoms, though neurologic and dermatologic findings are also well-described. The diagnosis  includes a combination of clinical and laboratory testing. Patients with MIS-C  will often have elevated inflammatory markers and may have an abnormal  ,  Context:  We report one of the earliest known U.S. cases of multisystem inflammatory  syndrome in children associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C).

A similar presentation in adults is termed as Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in Adults (MIS-A). Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a novel, life-threatening hyperinflammatory condition that develops in children a few weeks after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This disease has created a diagnostic challenge due to overlap with Kawasaki disease (KD) and KD shock syndrome. The majority of patients with MIS-C present with the involvement of at least four organ systems, and all have evidence of a marked inflammatory state. Most patients show an increase in the level of at least four inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, ferritin, procalcitonin, fibrinogen, interleukin-6, and triglycerides). Therapy is primarily with immunomodulators, suggesting that the disease is driven by post-infectious immune dysregulation.

List the deadliest viruses in the world.,Ebola and Marburg viruses are some of the deadliest viruses in the world.," Context:  The Ebola and Marburg viruses are some of the deadliest viruses in the world. In  this study a series of G-rich DNA sequences derived from these types of viruses  which possess the potential to form G-quadruplex structures are analyzed. A set of DNA oligonucleotides derived from original viral isolates was used as a  representative modeling sequence with which to demonstrate the influence of  thiazole orange on circular dichroism (CD) spectral profiles. The results show the unique profile of the induced CD (ICD) signal in the visible region caused  by interactions between the ligand and G-quadruplexes. This ligand was found to  stabilize the G-quadruplex structure and can also induce topological changes and  ,  Context:  The filoviruses, Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV), are among the  deadliest viruses that cause disease in humans, with reported case fatality  rates of up to 90% in some outbreaks. The high virulence of EBOV and MARV is largely attributed to the ability of these viruses to interfere with the host  immune response. Currently, there are no approved vaccines or postexposure  therapeutics, and treatment options for patients infected with EBOV are limited to supportive care. In this review, we discuss mechanisms of EBOV pathogenesis  and its ability to subvert host immunity as well as several vaccines and  therapeutics with respect to their evaluation in small animal models, nonhuman  ,  Context:  Viruses of the family Flaviviridae are important human and animal pathogens.  Among them, the Flaviviruses dengue (DENV) and West Nile (WNV) cause regular  outbreaks with fatal outcomes. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity of the non-structural protein 5 (NS5) is a key activity for viral RNA  replication. In this study, crystal structures of enzymatically active and  inactive WNV RdRp domains were determined at 3.0- and 2.35-A resolution, respectively. The determined structures were shown to be mostly similar to the  RdRps of the Flaviviridae members hepatitis C and bovine viral diarrhea virus,  although with unique elements characteristic for the WNV RdRp.

The  first of these to be discovered was yellow fever virus in 1901, and three to  four new species are still being found every year. Extrapolation of the discovery curve suggests that there is still a substantial pool of undiscovered  human virus species, although an apparent slow-down in the rate of discovery of  species from different families may indicate bounds to the potential range of diversity. More than two-thirds of human viruses can also infect non-human  hosts, mainly mammals, and sometimes birds. Many specialist human viruses also  have mammalian or avian origins.

Which interleukin receptors are targeted with rilonacept?,Rilonacept targets IL-1α and IL-1β receptors. It is a soluble IL-1 receptor chimeric fusion protein that neutralizes both IL-1α and IL-1β.," Context:  Rilonacept (IL-1 Trap/Arcalyst) is a long-acting interleukin-1 (IL-1) blocker  developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Initially, Regeneron entered into a  joint development effort with Novartis to develop rilonacept for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but this was discontinued following the review of  phase II clinical data showing that IL-1 blockade appeared to have limited  benefit in RA. In February 2008, Regeneron received Orphan Drug approval from the Food and Drug Administration for rilonacept in the treatment of two  cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) disorders, namely, familial  cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS),  ,  Context: cutaneous and articular (CINCA) syndrome, all associated with heterozygous  mutations in the NLRP3 (CIAS1) gene, which encodes the protein NLRP3 or  cryopyrin. Prior to the discovery of the NLRP3 (CIAS1) mutations and the advent  of IL-1-targeted therapy, treatment was aimed at suppressing inflammation but  with limited success. The dramatic success of selective blockade of IL-1beta,  initially with the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra; Kineret(R) or anakinra/  Amgen, Inc.), not only provided supportive evidence for the role of IL-1beta in  CAPS but also demonstrated the efficacy of targeting IL-1beta for treatment of  these conditions. A high-affinity protein called rilonacept has been produced by cytokine Trap technology and was developed by Regeneron. The desirable longer  half-life of rilonacept offers potential alternatives to patients who do not  tolerate daily injections very well or have difficulty with drug compliance. The initial evidence for the beneficial effects of rilonacept for MWS and FCAS  suggests that it would also be a suitable treatment for CNICA/NOMID. It is yet  to be determined whether rilonacept would be an effective treatment for other  ,  Context: Recent advances have shown impressive results by anti-interleukin 1 (IL-1)  agents in refractory idiopathic recurrent pericarditis. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We  critically discuss the current state of the art of therapy of relapsing  pericarditis, with a focus on new pharmacological approaches and on specific  clinical settings such as pregnancy, pediatric patients, and secondary forms of  relapsing pericarditis. RECENT FINDINGS: Antagonism of the IL-1 is highly  effective in idiopathic recurrent pericarditis with autoinflammatory features.  Currently, available anti-IL-1 agents are anakinra and canakinumab. Rilonacept  is another IL-1 antagonist, currently studied in the phase-3 clinical trial RHAPSODY. Available data suggest similar efficacy and safety profiles of these  three agents, although only anakinra has been tested in randomized clinical  trials. These agents have slightly different pharmacological properties, being canakinumab a specific IL-1ß antagonist while anakinra and rilonacept are  unselective IL-1α and IL-1ß blockers. To date, there is no evidence that  specificity against IL-1ß affects safety and efficacy in patients with relapsing  ,  Context: of IL-1-targeted therapy, treatment was aimed at suppressing inflammation but  with limited success.

Canakinumab, IL-1β  antibody, prevented the recurrence of ischemic events in patients with prior  acute myocardial infarction in a large phase III clinical trial, including  10 061 patients world-wide. Phase II clinical trials show promising data with  anakinra, recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, in patients with  ST-segment-elevation acute myocardial infarction or heart failure with reduced  ejection fraction. Anakinra also improved outcomes in patients with  pericarditis, and it is now considered standard of care as second-line treatment  for patients with recurrent/refractory pericarditis. Rilonacept, a soluble IL-1 receptor chimeric fusion protein neutralizing IL-1α and IL-1β, has also shown  promising results in a phase II study in recurrent/refractory pericarditis. In  conclusion, there is overwhelming evidence linking the NLRP3 inflammasome and the IL-1 cytokines with the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. The future  will likely include targeted inhibitors to block the IL-1 isoforms, and possibly  oral NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, across a wide spectrum of cardiovascular  diseases.

Which are the enzymes involved in the control of tubulin acetylation?,HDAC6 is a deacetylase enzyme that plays a key role in maintaining typical distribution of acetylated microtubules in cells. SIRT2 is another deacetylase enzyme involved in the regulation of tubulin acetylation," Context:  Glutamylation, the most prevalent tubulin posttranslational modification, marks  stable microtubules and regulates recruitment and activity of microtubule-  interacting proteins. Nine enzymes of the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) family catalyze glutamylation. TTLL7, the most abundant neuronal glutamylase,  adds glutamates preferentially to the β-tubulin tail. Coupled with ensemble and  single-molecule biochemistry, our hybrid X-ray and cryo-electron microscopy structure of TTLL7 bound to the microtubule delineates a tripartite microtubule  recognition strategy. The enzyme uses its core to engage the disordered anionic  tails of α- and β-tubulin, and a flexible cationic domain to bind the  ,  Context:  The post-translational modification of tubulin appears to be a highly controlled  mechanism that regulates microtubule functioning. Acetylation of the ε-amino  group of Lys-40 of α-tubulin marks stable microtubules, although the causal relationship between tubulin acetylation and microtubule stability has remained  poorly understood. HDAC6, the tubulin deacetylase, plays a key role in  maintaining typical distribution of acetylated microtubules in cells. Here, by using tubastatin A, an HDAC6-specific inhibitor, and siRNA-mediated depletion of  HDAC6, we have explored whether tubulin acetylation has a role in regulating  microtubule stability. We found that whereas both pharmacological inhibition of  ,  Context: It has been shown that Wallerian degeneration, an anterograde degeneration of  transected axons, is markedly delayed in a mutant mouse called slow Wallerian  degeneration (Wld(S)). These mice also show resistance to axonal degeneration  caused by microtubule depolymerizing drugs, suggesting that axonal microtubules  are stabilized. Here, we have focused on tubulin acetylation, a  post-translational modification associated with microtubule stability. We found that the basal level of microtubule acetylation was increased in cultured  cerebellar granule cells from Wld(S) mice. Nicotinamide but not  3-aminobenzamide, an inhibitor for poly(ADP)ribose polymerase, enhanced tubulin acetylation and resistance to axonal degeneration in cultured cerebellar granule  cells from wild-type (WT) mice, suggesting that mammalian Sir2-related protein  (SIRT) 2, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)--dependent tubulin  ,  Context: invasion is necessary for the better clinical therapy and improvements of the  patients' quality of life. Microtubules in eukaryotic cells reveal the shape of  hollow cylinders made up of polymerized alpha (α)- and beta (β)-tubulin dimers  and form the cytoskeleton together with microfilaments and intermediate  filaments. Microtubules play important roles in cell migration by undergoing  assembly and disassembly with post-translational modifications. Stability of  microtubules caused by their acetylation is involved in cell migration. In this  study, we investigated the expression and distribution of acetylated α-tubulin  and alpha-tubulin N-acetyltransferase 1 (αTAT1), an enzyme which acetylates Lys-40 in α-tubulin, in AB specimens, and analyzed how tubulin was acetylated by  αTAT1 activation in a human AB cell line, AM-1. Finally, we clarified that  TGF-β-activated kinase1 (TAK1) was phosphorylated by TGF-β stimulation, then, induced tubulin acetylation via αTAT1 activation, which subsequently activated  the migration and invasion of AB cells.  ,  Context:  Angiotensin II has been implicated in vascular remodeling. Microtubule composed  of tubulins regulates cell shape, migration and survival. Tubulin acetylation  has an important role in the control of microtubule structure and microtubule-based cellular functions. In this study, angiotensin II induced  disassembly and deacetylation of α-tubulin, which were blocked by pretreatment  with an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker losartan and a sirtuin class deacetylase inhibitor sirtinol, and by depletion of a deacetylase SIRT2 using  RNA interference. We investigated the involvement of SIRT2 in angiotensin  II-induced endothelial cell migration using the Boyden chamber method.  ,  Context: Neuronal migration is a fundamental process during the development of the  cerebral cortex and is regulated by cytoskeletal components. Microtubule  dynamics can be modulated by posttranslational modifications to tubulin  subunits. Acetylation of α-tubulin at lysine 40 is important in regulating  microtubule properties, and this process is controlled by acetyltransferase and  deacetylase. MEC-17 is a newly discovered α-tubulin acetyltransferase that has been found to play a major role in the acetylation of α-tubulin in different  species in vivo. However, the physiological function of MEC-17 during neural  development is largely unknown. Here, we report that MEC-17 is critical for the migration of cortical neurons in the rat. MEC-17 was strongly expressed in the  cerebral cortex during development.

Are TAMs good anticancer therapeutic targets?,"Yes, TAMs are considered good anticancer therapeutic targets because targeting them has yielded promising results in preclinical trials, and integrating therapeutic strategies to target TAMs can complement conventional therapies. Additionally, re-educating TAMs towards an antitumor phenotype"," Context: macrophages (TAM), a major component of the TME, in the response of tumors to  cancer therapy. We discuss the normal role of macrophages in wound healing, the  major phenotypes of TAMs, and their role in blunting the efficacy of cancer  treatment by radiation and anticancer drugs, both by promoting tumor  angiogenesis and by suppressing antitumor immunity. Finally, we review the many  preclinical studies that have shown that the response of tumors to irradiation  and anticancer drugs can be improved, sometimes markedly so, by depleting TAMs  from tumors or by suppressing their polarization from an M1 to an M2 phenotype.

How does Rif1 regulate DNA replication?,"Rif1 regulates DNA replication by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of the MCM complex, thereby opposing DDK function. It also establishes mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being"," Context: identified as a telomeric protein, was recently implicated in specifying  replication timing in yeast and mammals. We show that this function of Rif1  depends on its interaction with PP1 phosphatases. Mutations of two PP1 docking  motifs in Rif1 lead to early replication of telomeres in budding yeast and  misregulation of origin firing in fission yeast. Several lines of evidence  indicate that Rif1/PP1 counteract DDK activity on the replicative MCM helicase.  Our data suggest that the PP1/Rif1 interaction is downregulated by the  phosphorylation of Rif1, most likely by CDK/DDK. These findings elucidate the  mechanism of action of Rif1 in the control of DNA replication and demonstrate a role of PP1 phosphatases in the regulation of origin firing.  ,  Context: Rif1 interacts with PP1 and that PP1 prevents premature Mcm4 phosphorylation.  Remarkably, our results suggest that replication repression by Rif1 is itself  also DDK-regulated through phosphorylation near the PP1-interacting motifs.  Based on our findings, we propose that Rif1 is a novel PP1 substrate targeting  subunit that counteracts DDK-mediated phosphorylation during replication.  Fission yeast and mammalian Rif1 proteins have also been implicated in  regulating DNA replication. Since PP1 interaction sites are evolutionarily  conserved within the Rif1 sequence, it is likely that replication control by  Rif1 through PP1 is a conserved mechanism.  ,  Context: Rif1 results in specific loss of mid-S replication foci profiles, stimulation of  initiation events in early-S-phase and changes in long-range replication timing  domain structures. Analyses of replication timing show replication of sequences  normally replicating early is delayed, whereas that normally replicating late is  advanced, suggesting that replication timing regulation is abrogated in the  absence of Rif1. Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at  late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1  colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes  the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at early-S-phase. Our results indicate that Rif1 plays crucial roles in determining  the replication timing domain structures in human cells through regulating  higher-order chromatin architecture.  ,  Context: 1) controls DNA replication genome-wide and describe how Rif1 opposes DDK  function by directing Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated dephosphorylation of  the MCM complex. Deleting RIF1 partially compensates for the limited DDK  activity in a cdc7-1 mutant strain by allowing increased, premature  phosphorylation of Mcm4. PP1 interaction motifs within the Rif1 N-terminal  domain are critical for its repressive effect on replication. We confirm that  Rif1 interacts with PP1 and that PP1 prevents premature Mcm4 phosphorylation.  Remarkably, our results suggest that replication repression by Rif1 is itself  also DDK-regulated through phosphorylation near the PP1-interacting motifs. Based on our findings, we propose that Rif1 is a novel PP1 substrate targeting  subunit that counteracts DDK-mediated phosphorylation during replication.  Fission yeast and mammalian Rif1 proteins have also been implicated in regulating DNA replication. Since PP1 interaction sites are evolutionarily  conserved within the Rif1 sequence, it is likely that replication control by  Rif1 through PP1 is a conserved mechanism.  ,  Context: DNA replication is spatially and temporally regulated during S-phase. DNA  replication timing is established in early-G1-phase at a point referred to as  timing decision point. However, how the genome-wide replication timing domains  are established is unknown. Here, we show that Rif1 (Rap1-interacting-factor-1),  originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast, is a critical  determinant of the replication timing programme in human cells. Depletion of  Rif1 results in specific loss of mid-S replication foci profiles, stimulation of  initiation events in early-S-phase and changes in long-range replication timing  domain structures. Analyses of replication timing show replication of sequences normally replicating early is delayed, whereas that normally replicating late is  advanced, suggesting that replication timing regulation is abrogated in the  absence of Rif1. Rif1 tightly binds to nuclear-insoluble structures at late-M-to-early-G1 and regulates chromatin-loop sizes. Furthermore, Rif1  colocalizes specifically with the mid-S replication foci. Thus, Rif1 establishes  the mid-S replication domains that are restrained from being activated at  ,  Context: factors. Rif1 has recently been identified as a genome-wide regulator of  replication timing in fission yeast and in mammalian cells. However, previous  studies in budding yeast have suggested that Rif1's role in controlling  replication timing may be limited to subtelomeric domains and derives from its  established role in telomere length regulation. We have analyzed replication  timing by analyzing BrdU incorporation genome-wide, and report that Rif1  regulates the timing of late/dormant replication origins throughout the S.  cerevisiae genome. Analysis of pfa4Δ cells, which are defective in  palmitoylation and membrane association of Rif1, suggests that replication timing regulation by Rif1 is independent of its role in localizing telomeres to  the nuclear periphery. Intra-S checkpoint signaling is intact in rif1Δ cells,  and checkpoint-defective mec1Δ cells do not comparably deregulate replication timing, together indicating that Rif1 regulates replication timing through a  mechanism independent of this checkpoint. Our results indicate that the Rif1  mechanism regulates origin timing irrespective of proximity to a chromosome end,  ","24656819, 24532715, 22850674, 24532715, 22850674, 24879017","Rif1 (Rap1-interacting-factor-1), originally identified as a telomere-binding factor in yeast, is a critical determinant of the replication timing programme in human cells.

Here we used a DHX36 truncation to examine the roles of the 13-amino acid DHX36-specific motif (DSM) in DNA G4 recognition and disruption. We found that  the DSM promotes G4 recognition and specificity by increasing the G4 binding  rate of DHX36 without affecting the dissociation rate. Further, for most of the G4s measured, the DSM has little or no effect on the G4 disruption step by  DHX36, implying that contacts with the G4 are maintained through the transition  state for G4 disruption.

What is the Drosophila melanogaster Groucho protein?,"The Drosophila melanogaster Groucho (Gro) protein is a transcriptional corepressor that directly interacts with the histone deacetylase Rpd3. It has five identifiable regions, including the amino-terminal glutamine-rich Q"," Context:  The Drosophila Groucho (Gro) protein was the founding member of the family of  transcriptional co-repressor proteins that now includes the transducin-like  enhancer of split (TLE) and Grorelated gene (Grg) proteins in vertebrates. Gro family proteins do not bind DNA directly, but are recruited by a diverse profile  of transcription factors, including members of the Hes, Runx, Nkx, LEF1/Tcf,  Pax, Six and c-Myc families. The primary structure of Gro proteins includes five identifiable regions, of which the most highly conserved are the amino-terminal  glutamine-rich Q domain and the carboxy-terminal WD-repeat domain. The Q domain  contains two coiled-coil motifs that facilitate oligomerization into tetramers  ,  Context:  Groucho (Gro) is a Drosophila melanogaster transcriptional corepressor that  directly interacts with the histone deacetylase Rpd3. Although previous studies  suggest that this interaction is required for repression of Gro-responsive reporters in cultured cells, the in vivo significance of this interaction and  the mechanism by which it leads to repression remain largely unexplored. In this  study, we show that Gro is partially dependent on Rpd3 for repression, supporting the idea that Rpd3-mediated repression is one mode of Gro-mediated  repression.

Most proteins in the grg family contain all  of the domains found in the Drosophila Groucho protein, including the S/P  (Ser-Pro-rich) domain required for interaction with transcription factors and  the WD40 domain, which is thought to interact with other proteins. However, at least two Grg proteins contain only the amino-terminal Q (glutamine-rich)  domain. We examined whether the Q domain is used for dimerization between Grg  proteins, using the yeast two-hybrid system and binding assays with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. We found that Grg proteins are able to dimerize  through the Q domain and that dimerization requires a core of 50 amino acids.  Surprisingly, the dimerization does not require the leucine zipper located  within the Q domain.  ,  Context: The murine grg (Groucho-related gene) products are believed to interact with  transcription factors and repress transcription, thereby regulating cell  proliferation and differentiation.

Gro contains well-conserved domains at its N- and C-termini, and a poorly conserved central region that includes the GP, CcN,  and SP domains. All lethal point mutations in gro map to the conserved regions,  leading to speculation that the unconserved central domains are dispensable.

Is H4K20 methylation associated with DNA replication?,"H4K20 methylation is linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair, and DNA replication. Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated histone"," Context: Maintenance of genomic integrity is essential to ensure normal organismal  development and to prevent diseases such as cancer. Nuclear DNA is packaged into  chromatin, and thus genome maintenance can be influenced by distinct chromatin  environments. In particular, post-translational modifications of histones have  emerged as key regulators of genomic integrity. Intense research during the past  few years has revealed histone H4 lysine 20 methylation (H4K20me) as critically  important for the biological processes that ensure genome integrity, such as DNA  damage repair, DNA replication and chromatin compaction. The distinct H4K20  methylation states are mediated by SET8/PR-Set7 that catalyses monomethylation of H4K20, whereas SUV4-20H1 and SUV4-20H2 enzymes mediate further H4K20  methylation to H4K20me2 and H4K20me3. Disruption of these H4K20-specific histone  methyltransferases leads to genomic instability, demonstrating the important functions of H4K20 methylation in genome maintenance. In this review, we explain  molecular mechanisms underlying these defects and discuss novel ideas for  furthering our understanding of genome maintenance in higher eukaryotes.  ,  Context: The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to  chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication.  Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated  histone methyltransferase PR-Set7.

How could U1 small nuclear RNA be used in therapeutics?,"U1 small nuclear RNA can be used in therapeutics by loading it with complementarity to normal or mutated donor splice sites to correct exon skipping caused by mutations. It can also be used to carry antisense sequences, offering a long-term effect when delivered"," Context: A significant proportion of disease-causing mutations affect precursor-mRNA  splicing, inducing skipping of the exon from the mature transcript. Using F9  exon 5, CFTR exon 12 and SMN2 exon 7 models, we characterized natural mutations  associated to exon skipping in Haemophilia B, cystic fibrosis and spinal  muscular atrophy (SMA), respectively, and the therapeutic splicing rescue by  using U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA). In minigene expression systems, loading of U1 snRNA by complementarity to the normal or mutated donor splice sites (5'ss)  corrected the exon skipping caused by mutations at the polypyrimidine tract of  the acceptor splice site, at the consensus 5'ss or at exonic regulatory elements. To improve specificity and reduce potential off-target effects, we  developed U1 snRNA variants targeting non-conserved intronic sequences  downstream of the 5'ss. For each gene system, we identified an exon-specific U1  ,  Context: Antisense-mediated splicing modulation of premessenger RNA represents a novel  therapeutic strategy for several types of pathologies such as genetic disorders,  cancers, and infectious diseases. Antisense oligonucleotides designed to bind to  specific mRNA molecules have been actively developed for more than 20 years as a  form of molecular medicine to modulate splicing patterns or inhibit protein  translation. More recently, small nuclear RNA such as U7 or U1 small nuclear RNA have been used to carry antisense sequences, offering the advantage of long-term  effect when delivered to cells using viral vectors. We have previously  demonstrated the therapeutic potential of U7snRNA targeting dystrophin mRNA as a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In particular, we showed that  bifunctional U7 snRNAs harboring silencer motifs induce complete skipping of  exon 51, and thus restore dystrophin expression in DMD patients cells to near  ,  Context: We describe a gene silencing method that employs a mechanism of action distinct  from those of antisense and RNA interference. U1 Adaptors are bifunctional  oligonucleotides with a 'target domain' complementary to a site in the target  gene's terminal exon and a 'U1 domain' that binds to the U1 small nuclear RNA  component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP) splicing factor.  Tethering of U1 snRNP to the target pre-mRNA inhibits poly(A)-tail addition, causing degradation of that RNA species in the nucleus. U1 Adaptors can inhibit  both endogenous and reporter genes in a sequence-specific manner. Comparison of  U1 Adaptors with small interfering RNA (siRNA) using a genome-wide microarray analysis indicates that U1 Adaptors have limited off-target effects and no  detectable adverse effects on splicing. Further, targeting the same gene either  with multiple U1 Adaptors or with a U1 Adaptor and siRNA strongly enhances gene  silencing.  ,  Context: earlier stages of clinical development. This review highlights some of the  recent chemical and preclinical advances in this space, leading to a large  number of clinical candidates against a diverse range of targets in liver  hepatocytes. The review focuses on the use of this delivery system for small  interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and antisense molecules that cause downregulation of  target mRNA and protein. A number of other approaches such as anti-microRNAs and  small activating RNAs are starting to exploit the technology, broadening the  potential of this approach for therapeutic oligonucleotide intervention.  ,  Context:  RNA-based therapies, including RNA molecules as drugs and RNA-targeted small  molecules, offer unique opportunities to expand the range of therapeutic  targets.

"Are the human bombesin receptors, GRPR and NMBR, frequently overexpressed G-protein-coupled-receptors by lung-cancers?","Yes, the human bombesin receptors, GRPR and NMBR, are frequently overexpressed G-protein-coupled-receptors by lung cancers."," Context:  OBJECTIVE: Recent evidence suggests G-protein-coupled receptor-2-interacting  protein-1 (GIT1) overexpression in several human metastatic tumors, including  breast, lung, and prostate. Tumor metastasis is associated with an increase in angiogenesis. We have showed previously that GIT1 is required for postnatal  angiogenesis during lung development. However, the functional role of GIT1 in  pathological angiogenesis during tumor growth is unknown. APPROACH AND RESULTS: In the present study, we show inhibition of angiogenesis  in matrigel implants as well as reduced tumor angiogenesis and melanoma tumor  growth in GIT1-knockout mice. We demonstrate that this is a result of impaired  ,  Context:  Despite the fact that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate numerous  physiological processes and represent targets for therapeutics for a vast array  of diseases, their role in tumor biology is under appreciated. Protease-activated receptors (PARs) form a family which belongs to GPCR class A.  PAR1&2 emerge with a central role in epithelial malignancies. Although the part  of PAR1&2 in cancer is on the rise, their underlying signaling events are poorly understood. We review hereby past, present, and future cancer-associated PAR  biology. Mainly, their role in physiological (placenta-cytotophobalst) and  patho-physiological invasion processes. The identification and characterization  ,  Context:  Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are the  standard-of-care treatment for EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC).  However, most patients develop acquired drug resistance to EGFR TKIs. HER3 is a unique pseudokinase member of the ERBB family that functions by dimerizing with  other ERBB family members (EGFR and HER2) and is frequently overexpressed in  EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Although EGFR TKI resistance mechanisms do not lead to alterations in HER3, we hypothesized that targeting HER3 might improve efficacy  of EGFR TKI. HER3-DXd is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) comprised of  HER3-targeting antibody linked to a topoisomerase I inhibitor currently in  ,  Context: Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has diverse physiological roles as a  neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (1). It is involved in the  regulation and modulation of sleep, affective and personality behaviors, and  pain. It also is a regulator of smooth muscle function and platelet aggregation.  The brain cortical 5-HT system has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric  disorders, including major depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder,  and schizophrenia (2, 3). The effects of 5-HT are mediated by as many as seven  classes of receptor populations (5-HT1 to 5-HT7), many of which include several  subtypes (4). There are three receptor subtypes within the G-protein–coupled 5-HT2 receptor family: 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C. 5-HT2A receptors are  abundantly present in the cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, hippocampus,  amygdala, dorsal thalamus, hypothalamus, superior colliculus, substantia nigra, pedunculopontine nucleus, legmental area, and myelencephalon (5). 5-HT2A  receptors are involved in mediation of normal and psychotic states, working  memory, regulation of GABAergic and cholinergic neuronal cells, sleep,  ,  Context: Bombesin receptor subtype (BRS)-3 is a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) for the  bombesin (BB)-family of peptides. BRS-3 is an orphan GPCR and little is known of  its physiological role due to the lack of specific agonists and antagonists.  PD168368 is a nonpeptide antagonist for the neuromedin B (NMB) receptor (R)  whereas PD176252 is a nonpeptide antagonist for the gastrin releasing peptide  (GRP) R and NMBR but not BRS-3. Here nonpeptide analogs of PD176252 e.g. the  S-enantiomer ML-18, and the R-enantiomer, EMY-98, were investigated as BRS-3  antagonists using lung cancer cells.

The parity rules lay the foundation for  evaluating the biases in synonymous codon usage in terms of (1) directional  mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational  biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias  mutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional selection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance.

Such pressure led to changes in species-specific usages of codons and tRNA anticodons, and also in amino acid  assignments of codons in mitochondria and in several intact organisms.

What is the aim of iodine prophylaxis?,"To reduce the risk for radiogenic thyroid cancer by a factor of three in children, by administering potassium iodide (KI) to protect against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes."," Context: A potential radiation protection method to reduce the risk of adverse health  outcomes in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release is the  administration of potassium iodide (KI). Although KI administration is  recommended by WHO's Guidelines for Iodine Prophylaxis following Nuclear  Accidents, a systematic review of the scientific evidence for the guidelines is  lacking. Therefore, this study aims to systematically review the effects of KI administration in the case of accidental radioactive iodine release on thyroid  cancer, hypothyroidism and benign thyroid nodules. We applied standard  systematic review methodology for a search of the literature, selection of eligible studies, data extraction, assessment of risk of bias, assessment of  heterogeneity, data synthesis, and the assessment of the quality of the  evidence. We searched MEDLINE (via PubMed) and EMBASE. We found one  ,  Context: a factor of three. For children, the WHO has therefore recommended a 10 mGy  avertable dose to the thyroid. The Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority  acknowledge the WHO guidelines and advise that the first priority of all  emergency preparedness planning for potential releases that can cause dispersion  of radioactive iodine, should be given to the protection of pregnant and  breast-feeding women, newborns and children under 18 years. Iodine tablets  should be taken immediately (preferably not later than a few hours) in  situations where inhalation of radioactive iodine may occur. It should be  underlined that iodine prophylaxis is one of several emergency countermeasures; other measures are sheltering and evacuation. The latter two countermeasures  will protect not only from intake of radioactive iodine, but also against other  radionuclides that may be released. Based on the present risk assessment in Norway, iodine tablets have been distributed to the counties north of Salten. In  addition, there is an emergency stockpile of iodine tablets in Oslo.  ,  Context: Radioactive iodine isotopes may be released to air to a varying degree during  accidents with nuclear reactors. Iodine tablets, taken before or shortly after  such release, protect against intake of radioactive iodine isotopes, but not  against other radionuclides.

What is caused by biallelic variants in PCDHGC4?,"I am uncertain about what is caused by biallelic variants in PCDH19 (not PCDHGC4). However, I can tell you that mutations in PCDH19 are associated with epilepsy."," Context: Fanconi Anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by  congenital abnormalities, progressive bone marrow failure, and susceptibility to  cancer. FA has eight known complementation groups and is caused by mutations in  at least seven genes. Biallelic BRCA2 mutations were shown recently to cause  FA-D1. Monoallelic (heterozygous) BRCA2 mutations confer a high risk of breast  cancer and are a major cause of familial breast cancer. To investigate whether heterozygous variants in other FA genes are high penetrance breast cancer  susceptibility alleles, we screened germ-line DNA from 88 BRCA1/2-negative  families, each with at least three cases of breast cancer, for mutations in FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, and FANCG. Sixty-nine sequence variants were  identified of which 25 were exonic. None of the exonic variants resulted in  translational frameshifts or nonsense codons and 14 were polymorphisms  ,  Context:  Biallelic insulin receptor (INSR) gene mutations cause congenital syndromes of  severe insulin resistance (SIR) known as Donohue syndrome (DS) and  Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome (RMS). At presentation, DS and RMS are difficult to differentiate since they share many clinical features; however, while patients  with DS usually die within 1 year of birth, individuals classified as RMS can  reach adult age. INSR mutations can be also found in pubertal females with hyperinsulinism, hyperandrogenism, and acanthosis nigricans (type A SIR).

Majority of patients  have a mutation in SCN1A gene, which encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel. A  recent study has demonstrated that 16% of SCN1A-negative patients have a  mutation in PCDH19, the gene encoding protocadherin-19. Mutations in other genes  account for only a very small proportion of families. TSPYL4 is a novel  candidate gene within the locus 6q16.3-q22.31 identified by linkage study. OBJECTIVE: The present study examined the mutations in epileptic Chinese  children with emphasis on Dravet syndrome. METHODS: A hundred children with severe epilepsy were divided into Dravet syndrome and non-Dravet syndrome groups and screened for SCN1A mutations by  direct sequencing. SCN1A-negative Dravet syndrome patients and patients with  phenotypes resembling Dravet syndrome were checked for PCDH19 and TSPYL4  mutations.  ,  Context: Fanconi anaemia (FA) is an inherited condition characterised by congenital and  developmental abnormalities and a strong cancer predisposition.

We report an unanticipated link  between stress granules and the serine/threonine kinase RSK2. In stressed breast cells, endogenous RSK2 colocalizes in granules with TIA-1 and poly(A)-binding  protein 1, and the sequestration of RSK2 and TIA-1 exhibits codependency. The  RSK2 N-terminal kinase domain controls the direct interaction with the prion-related domain of TIA-1. Silencing RSK2 decreases cell survival in  response to stress. Mitogen releases RSK2 from the stress granules and permits  its nuclear import via a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence in the C-terminal  ,  Context: The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is a central kinase that coordinates  nutrient availability with eukaryotic cell growth. Although TORC1 signaling is  repressed by various stresses in yeast, the underlying mechanisms remain  elusive. Here we report that TORC1 signaling upon heat stress is regulated by  stress granules (SGs), which are cytoplasmic foci formed under certain stresses.  Ectopic formation of SGs achieved by Pbp1 overexpression in unstressed cells sequesters TORC1 in this compartment, thereby blunting TORC1 signaling. Upon  heat stress, a physiological SG-inducing condition, TORC1 is also recruited to  SGs, which delays reactivation of TORC1 signaling during recovery from heat stress. Moreover, TORC1 reactivation is directed through SG disassembly,  suggesting that SGs act as a key determinant for TORC1 reactivation during  recovery from heat stress.

Although multiple stimuli can activate these two stress kinase  pathways, the functional interactions and molecular cross-talks between these common second signaling cascades are poorly elucidated. Here we report that JNK  and p38-MAPK pathways antagonistically control cellular senescence, oncogenic  transformation, and proliferation in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Similarly, genetic inactivation of the JNK pathway results in impaired  proliferation of fetal hepatoblasts in vitro and defective adult liver  regeneration in vivo, which is rescued by inhibition of the p38-MAPK pathway.  ,  Context:  The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is a central kinase that coordinates  nutrient availability with eukaryotic cell growth.

Upon  heat stress, a physiological SG-inducing condition, TORC1 is also recruited to  SGs, which delays reactivation of TORC1 signaling during recovery from heat  ","18775331, 22727621, 25840010, 25840010, 17762881, 22727621",5'-AMP-activated protein kinase alpha regulates stress granule biogenesis,25840010
What is the function of PAPOLA/PAP?,"PAPOLA/PAP's function is implied to be regulated by translational regulation, as mutation of the 5' proximal AUG resulted in increased translational efficiency of the adjacent coding sequence."," Context: this enzyme was addressed. The transcription start site was mapped and two  uORFs, highly conserved among several species, were identified in the 211-bp  long, GC-rich, 5' UTR of the PAPOLA mRNA.

Which gene is the paralog of yeast UPC2?,"YLR228c is a predicted transcriptional activator and is highly homologous to Upc2p, with 130 out of the last 139 amino acids being similar between the two proteins."," Context:  Upc2, a zinc-cluster transcription factor, is a regulator of ergosterol  biosynthesis in yeast. In response to sterol levels, the transcriptional  activity of Upc2 is controlled by the C-terminal domain. In this study, the C-terminal regulatory domain of Upc2 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified  and crystallized by the vapour-diffusion method. To improve the diffraction  quality of Upc2 crystals, a Upc2 fusion protein in which 11 residues of the variable loop (residues 715-725) were replaced by T4 lysozymes in Upc2  (Upc2-T4L) was engineered. The Upc2-T4L crystals diffracted to 2.9 Å resolution  using synchrotron radiation. The crystal was trigonal, belonging to space group  ,  Context:  Budding yeast mating is an excellent model for receptor-activated cell  differentiation. Here we identify the related transcription factors Ecm22 and  Upc2 as novel regulators of mating. Cells lacking both ECM22 and UPC2 display strong mating defects whereas deletion of either gene has no effect. Ecm22 and  Upc2 positively regulate basal expression of PRM1 and PRM4. These genes are  strongly induced in response to mating pheromone, which is also largely dependent on ECM22 and UPC2. We further show that deletion of PRM4 like PRM1  results in markedly reduced mating efficiency. Expression of PRM1 but not of  PRM4 is also regulated by Ste12, a key transcription factor for mating. STE12  ,  Context: budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These proteins also control adaptations  to anaerobic growth, sterol biosynthesis as well as filamentation and mating.  Orthologs of these zinc cluster proteins have been identified in several species  of Candida. Upc2 plays a critical role in antifungal resistance in these  important human fungal pathogens. Upc2 is therefore an interesting potential  target for novel antifungals. In this review we discuss the functions, mode of  actions and regulation of Ecm22, Upc2, Sut1 and Sut2 in budding yeast and  Candida.  ,  Context: still gigantic networks and the analysis of these networks will permit the  emergence of a more integrated view of protein function. In this context, we  propose a new functional classification method, which, unlike usual methods  based on sequence homology, allows the definition of functional classes of  protein based on the identity of their interacting partners. An example of such  classification will be shown and discussed for a subset of Saccharomyces  cerevisiae proteins, accounting for 7% of the yeast proteome. The genome of the  budding yeast contains 50% of protein-coding genes that are paralogs, including  457 pairs of duplicated genes coming probably from an ancient whole genome duplication. We will comment on the functional classification of the duplicated  genes when using our method and discuss the contribution of these results to the  understanding of function evolution for the duplicated genes.  ,  Context: allows a high level of aerobic sterol uptake. Another predicted transcriptional  activator, the YLR228c gene product, is highly homologous to Upc2p. In fact, at  the carboxy terminus 130 of the last 139 amino acids are similar between the two  proteins. Since these proteins are very similar, the effect of mutations in the  YLR228c open reading frame (ORF) was compared with like alterations in UPC2.  First, the YLR228c ORF was insertionally inactivated and crossed with various  UPC2 constructs. Deletion of YLR228c and UPC2 in combination resulted in  nonviability, suggesting that the two proteins have some essential overlapping  function. The upc2-1 point mutation responsible for aerobic sterol uptake was duplicated in the homologous carboxy region of the YLR228c ORF using  site-directed mutagenesis. This mutation on a high-copy vector resulted in an  increase in sterol uptake compared to an isogenic wild-type strain. The combination of both point mutations resulted in the greatest level of aerobic  sterol uptake.

PATIENT SUMMARY: Oral once-daily relugolix may be a novel oral alternative to  injectable androgen deprivation therapies.  ,  Context: Uterine leiomyomas represent the most common form of benign gynecological tumors  affecting 20-40% of women during their life. Several therapeutic options are  available for treating these patients. The use of medical treatment for myomas  has largely grown in the last years, in particular for women who would refuse,  postpone or are not candidates for surgery. In the last years, the clinical  investigation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists (GnRH-ants)  has emerged. This class of drugs exerts pure competitive antagonistic activity  on the GnRH receptor at the pituitary gland, producing an immediate stop in the  release of gonadotropins and sex steroids. Relugolix is an orally active nonpeptide GnRH-ant, recently licensed for marketing in Japan for the treatment  of symptoms related to uterine myomas.

What is BBCAnalyzer?,BBCAnalyzer (Bases By CIGAR Analyzer) is a tool that provides a novel visual approach to facilitate the inspection of common mutation sites by visualizing base counts at predefined positions or regions in sequence alignment data available as BAM files.," Context: BACKGROUND: Deriving valid variant calling results from raw next-generation  sequencing data is a particularly challenging task, especially with respect to  clinical diagnostics and personalized medicine.

The process of matching peptide sequences against a  genome translated in six reading frames is part of a proteogenomic mapping  pipeline that is used as a case-study. The Aho-Corasick algorithm is adapted for  execution in field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices in a manner that optimizes space and performance. In this approach, the traditional Aho-Corasick  finite state machine (FSM) is split into smaller FSMs, operating in parallel,  each of which matches up to 20 peptides in the input translated genome. Each of the smaller FSMs is further divided into five simpler FSMs such that each simple  FSM operates on a single bit position in the input (five bits are sufficient for  representing all amino acids and special symbols in protein sequences).  ,  Context: e.g., new protein sequences are compared with a set of HMMs to detect functional  similarities. Efficient dynamic-programming algorithms exist for solving this  problem; however, current solutions still require significant scan times. These  scan time requirements are likely to become even more severe due to the rapid  growth in the size of these databases. This paper shows how reconfigurable  architectures can be used to derive an efficient fine-grained parallelization of  the dynamic programming calculation.

Which are the main functions of the human HuR (ELAVL1) protein in fibroblasts?,"HuR (ELAVL1) regulates transcript stability and translation by binding to the 3'-untranslated region of mRNAs. In fibroblasts, HuR is involved in post-transcriptional regulation, particularly in the stabilization and"," Context:  HuR, also known as Elavl1, is an RNA-binding protein that regulates embryonic  development, progenitor cell survival, and cell stress responses. The role of  HuR in angiogenesis is not known. Using a myeloid-specific HuR knock-out mouse model (Elavl1Mø KO), we show that HuR expression in bone marrow-derived  macrophages (BMDMs) is needed to maintain the expression of genes enriched in  AU-rich elements and U-rich elements in the 3'-UTR. In addition, BMDMs from Elavl1Mø KO mice also showed alterations in expression of several miRNAs.  Interestingly, computational analysis suggested that miR-200b, which is  up-regulated in Elavl1Mø KO BMDMs, interacts with myeloid mRNAs very close to  ,  Context:  The RNA-binding protein HuR (also known as ELAV1) binds to the 3'-untranslated  region of mRNAs and regulates transcript stability and translation. However, the  in vivo functions of HuR are not well understood. Here, we report that murine HuR is essential for life; postnatal global deletion of Elavl1 induced atrophy  of hematopoietic organs, extensive loss of intestinal villi, obstructive  enterocolitis, and lethality within 10 days.

Upon Elavl1 deletion, progenitor cells in the BM, thymus, and intestine underwent apoptosis, whereas quiescent  stem cells and differentiated cells were unaffected. The survival defect of  hematopoietic progenitor cells was cell intrinsic, as transplant of Elavl1-/- BM  ,  Context: Occludin is a transmembrane tight junction (TJ) protein that plays an important  role in TJ assembly and regulation of the epithelial barrier function, but the  mechanisms underlying its post-transcriptional regulation are unknown. The  RNA-binding protein HuR modulates the stability and translation of many target  mRNAs. Here, we investigated the role of HuR in the regulation of occludin  expression and therefore in the intestinal epithelial barrier function. HuR bound the 3'-untranslated region of the occludin mRNA and enhanced occludin  translation. HuR association with the occludin mRNA depended on Chk2-dependent  HuR phosphorylation. Reduced HuR phosphorylation by Chk2 silencing or by reduction of Chk2 through polyamine depletion decreased HuR-binding to the  occludin mRNA and repressed occludin translation, whereas Chk2 overexpression  enhanced (HuR/occludin mRNA) association and stimulated occludin expression. In  ,  Context:  The activities of RNA-binding proteins are perturbed in several pathological  conditions, including cancer. These proteins include tristetraprolin (TTP,  ZFP36) and HuR (ELAVL1), which respectively promote the decay or stability of adenylate-uridylate-rich (AU-rich) mRNAs. Here, we demonstrated that increased  stabilization and subsequent over-expression of HuR mRNA were coupled to TTP  deficiency. These findings were observed in breast cancer cell lines with an invasive phenotype and were further confirmed in ZFP36-knockout mouse  fibroblasts. We show that TTP-HuR imbalance correlated with increased expression  of AU-rich element (ARE) mRNAs that code for cancer invasion genes. The microRNA  ,  Context: preadipocytes and adipocytes and in vitro RNA gel shifts indicate the mRNA is a  ligand for HuR. However, HuR complexes containing the GLUT1 mRNA can only be  isolated from the terminally differentiated adipocytes. Moreover, position  analysis of the GLUT1 mRNA and HuR protein in polysome profiles demonstrates a  shift to the most dense region of the gradient for both message and protein with  adipocyte differentiation. Consistent with a regulatory role in the control of  GLUT1 expression, siRNA-mediated decrease in HuR protein resulted in a decreased  expression of GLUT1 protein. These data suggest that HuR contributes to the  metabolic function of the adipocyte through mediation of post-transcriptional regulatory events.  ","23223443, 19884656, 19884656, 21745814, 23401122, 16639702","HuR is an RNA-binding protein that can stabilize labile mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3' untranslated regions and has been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a ""young cell"" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. Loss of HuR is linked to reduced expression of proliferative genes during replicative senescence. Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a ""younger"" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels. In mesenchymal cells HuR plays a dominant role in lung development and as a key post-transcriptional regulator of networks guiding tissue remodeling during branching morphogenesis. In fibroblasts knockdown of HuR decreased the endogenous expression of TGFβ1 under exogenous TGFβ1 treatment, simultaneously with the decrease of Col1a, Col3a and fibronectin expression.  HuR (human antigen R), represses ARF mRNA translation, thereby maintaining the replicative life span of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). HuR is considered a global regulator of cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis. Through its post-transcriptional influence on specific target mRNAs, HuR can alter the cellular response to proliferative, stress, apoptotic, differentiation, senescence, inflammatory and immune stimuli.","17392515, 15861128, 23508105, 22201738, 19345675, 23223443, 21816340, 22310293, 21745814, 19289500, 17288991, 23401122, 21164076, 23837869, 19252527, 9763509, 23155001, 14530362, 15543229, 11486028, 15863502, 10673359, 9628881, 16639702, 9155038, 10075998, 9860962, 20007147, 19884656, 15036402, 15824116, 21515253, 12605686, 24152440, 17317627, 22446588, 12242302, 12730239"
What is the major sequence determinant for nucleosome positioning?,"DNA deformation energy is a major determinant of nucleosome positioning, specifically the anisotropic flexibility of pyrimidine-purine (YR) dimeric steps in the context of their neighbors."," Context:  Recent studies of genome-wide nucleosomal organization suggest that the DNA  sequence is one of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning. Although  the search for underlying patterns encoded in nucleosomal DNA has been going on for about 30 years, our knowledge of these patterns still remains limited. Based  on our evaluations of DNA deformation energy, we developed new scoring functions  to predict nucleosome positioning. There are three principal differences between our approach and earlier studies: (i) we assume that the length of nucleosomal  DNA varies from 146 to 147 bp; (ii) we consider the anisotropic flexibility of  pyrimidine-purine (YR) dimeric steps in the context of their neighbors (e.g.,  ,  Context: Eukaryotic genomes are packed into chromatin, whose basic repeating unit is the  nucleosome. Nucleosome positioning is a widely researched area. A common  experimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of  micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase  in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the  resulting fragments. This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and  especially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. As a  consequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major  determinant of nucleosome positioning in vivo. More generally, our results show that data generated after MNase digestion of chromatin requires a matched  control experiment in order to determine nucleosome positions.  ,  Context: Eukaryotic genomes are packed into chromatin, whose basic repeating unit is the  nucleosome.

Some DNA sequence patterns can facilitate nucleosome formation,  while others can inhibit nucleosome formation. Nucleosome positioning influences the overall rate of sequence evolution. However, its impacts on specific  patterns of sequence evolution are still poorly understood. RESULTS: Here, we examined whether nucleosomal DNA and nucleosome-depleted DNA show distinct polymorphism patterns to maintain adequate nucleosome architecture  on a genome scale in yeast. We found that sequence polymorphisms in nucleosomal  DNA tend to facilitate nucleosome formation, whereas polymorphisms in  ,  Context: A major question in chromatin biology is to what extent the sequence of DNA  directly determines the genetic and chromatin organization of a eukaryotic  genome? We consider two aspects to this question: the DNA sequence-specified  positioning of nucleosomes and the determination of NDRs (nucleosome-depleted  regions) or barriers. We argue that, in budding yeast, while DNA  sequence-specified nucleosome positioning may contribute to positions flanking the regions lacking nucleosomes, DNA thermodynamic stability is a major  component determinant of the genetic organization of this organism.  ,  Context: A program for constructing nucleosome formation potential profile was applied  for investigation of exons, introns, and repetitive sequences. The program is  available at http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/programs/recon/. We have  demonstrated that introns and repetitive sequences exhibit higher nucleosome  formation potentials than exons. This fact may be explained by functional  saturation of exons with genetic code, hindering the localization of efficient  nucleosome positioning sites.

In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial.  Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous  lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes  SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted  TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic  cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each  cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males.

SLE prevalence is also  elevated in individuals with Klinefelter syndrome, who carry one or more  supernumerary X chromosomes, suggesting that the X chromosome complement  contributes to SLE susceptibility. TLR7 is encoded by an X chromosome locus, and we examined here whether the TLR7 gene evades silencing by X chromosome  inactivation in immune cells from women and Klinefelter syndrome males.  Single-cell analyses of TLR7 allelic expression demonstrated that substantial fractions of primary B lymphocytes, monocytes, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells  not only in women but also in Klinefelter syndrome males express TLR7 on both X  chromosomes.

Which are the ligands of the Roundabout (Robo) receptors?,The ligand of the Roundabout (Robo) family receptors is Slit protein.," Context:  The repellant ligand Slit and its Roundabout (Robo) family receptors regulate  midline crossing of axons during development of the embryonic central nervous  system (CNS). Slit proteins are produced at the midline and signal through Robo receptors to repel axons from the midline. Disruption of Slit-Robo signaling  causes ectopic midline-crossing phenotypes in the CNS of a broad range of  animals, including insects and vertebrates. While previous studies have investigated the roles of Drosophila melanogaster Robo1's five  Immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains, little is known about the importance of the  three evolutionarily conserved Fibronectin (Fn) type-III repeats. We have  ,  Context:  The creation of complex neuronal networks relies on ligand-receptor interactions  that mediate attraction or repulsion towards specific targets.

Furthermore, saracatinib stimulated the ATPase activity and inhibited  photolabeling of ABCB1 with [(125)I]-iodoarylazidoprazosin in a  concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the homology modeling predicted the  binding conformation of saracatinib within the large hydrophobic drug-binding  cavity of human ABCB1.

In contrast to the more common presentation of  congenital Horner syndrome, the affected iris in this case was the darker of the  two because of the effects of the concomitant Waardenburg syndrome on the contralateral iris pigmentation. We are unaware of any other cases presenting  with both Horner and Waardenburg syndromes and believe that this case serves as  an excellent opportunity to briefly review the pathophysiology involved with  these disorders.  ,  Context:  Reporting one case of this condition type-2 with heterochromia iridis and  cochlear deafness. The AA. review the syndrome's components and it nomenclature  as well. They discuss about the convenience of including this deviation in the chapter of ""diseases of the embryonic neural crest"". The specific place of the  gene responsibly in the chromosome-2 and the possibilities of genetic  counselling are considered.  ,  Context:  Waardenburg's syndrome consists of lateral displacement of the inner canthi of  the eyes (dystopia canthorum), a broad nasal root and confluent eyebrows,  heterochromia iridum, a white forelock and congenital deafness. The syndrome is inherited as a dominant, but affected individuals do not necessarily have all of  the characteristics cited.Five hundred and fourteen pupils at a school for the  deaf were screened for features of this syndrome. Three cases were discovered. Eleven other deaf children were found to have heterochromia iridum and two more  had white forelocks. The interocular dimensions of the remaining children were  recorded as standards by which to judge the presence of dystopia canthorum. The  ,  Context:  Horner's syndrome (HS) is related to an interruption of the oculosympathetic  nerve pathway. The classic clinical findings associated with this condition are  ptosis, miosis, and enophthalmos. Heterochromia is typically described in congenital HS, but it is an uncommon finding in acquired HS. We report a case of  post-traumatic HS associated with heterochromia. A literature review indicates  that this type of heterochromia may be related to a reduction in the number of iris melanocytes. This mechanism may be the same in the physiological iris color  modifications in adulthood.

Have thyronamines effects on fat tissue?,"Yes, thyronamines have effects on fat tissue. They can reduce mitochondrial O2 consumption and increase H2O2 release in rat liver mitochondria. Additionally, TSH induced lipolysis in adipose tissues, suggesting that thyronamines may"," Context: release by rat liver mitochondria. Hypothyroid animals were used because of the  low levels of endogenous thyronamines. We found that both compounds are able to  reduce mitochondrial O(2) consumption and increase H(2)O(2) release. The  observed changes could be explained by a partial block, operated by  thyronamines, at a site located near the site of action of antimycin A. This  hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that thyronamines reduced the  activity of Complex III where the site of antimycin action is located. Because  thyronamines exerted their effects at concentrations comparable to those found  in hepatic tissue, it is conceivable that they can affect in vivo mitochondrial O(2) consumption and H(2)O(2) production acting as modulators of thyroid hormone  action.  ,  Context: Sulfotransferases (SULTs) catalyze the sulfation of many endogenous compounds  that include monoamine neurotransmitters, such as dopamine (DA), and thyroid  hormones (iodothyronines). Decarboxylation of iodothyronines results in  formation of thyronamines. In the mouse, thyronamines act rapidly in a  nongenomic fashion to initiate hypothermia and decrease cardiac output and heart  rate. These effects are attenuated after 1-4 h, and metabolism of thyronamines via sulfation may be a mechanism for termination of thyronamine action. We  carried out this study to test thyronamine (T0AM), 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM),  3,5-diiodothyronamine (T2AM), and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronamine (T3AM) as substrates for human liver and cDNA-expressed SULT activities. We characterized several  biochemical properties of SULTs using the thyronamines that acted as substrates  for SULT activities in a human liver high-speed supernatant pool (n=3). T1AM led  ,  Context: hormone and TSH was intact in one and disrupted in the other. One model,  thyroidectomized (THYx) mice, had a 100-fold increase in TSH and a normal TSH  receptor (TSHR); in contrast, the other model, hyt/hyt mice, had a 120-fold  elevation of TSH but a nonfunctional TSHR. Although both THYx and hyt/hyt mice  were in a severe hypothyroid state, the epididymal fat (mg)/body wt (g) (F/B)  ratio of THYx mice was much smaller than that of hyt/hyt mice (8.2 ± 0.43 vs.  14.4 ± 0.40, respectively, P < 0.001). The fat cell diameter in THYx mice was  also smaller than that in hyt/hyt mice (79 ± 2.8 vs. 105 ± 2.2 μm, respectively,  P < 0.001), suggesting that TSH induced lipolysis in adipose tissues. When we transferred a functional mouse TSHR gene and a control plasmid into opposite  sides of epididymal fat of hyt/hyt mice by plasmid injection combined with  electroporation, fat weight of the TSHR side was decreased to 60% of that of the control side. Messenger RNA levels of hormone-sensitive lipase in epididymal fat  containing the transferred TSHR gene were twofold higher than those in tissue  from the control side. These results indicated that TSH worked as a lipolytic  ,  Context: The worldwide prevalence of obesity-associated pathologies, including type 2  diabetes, requires thorough investigation of mechanisms and interventions.  Recent studies have highlighted thyroid hormone analogs and derivatives as  potential agents able to counteract such pathologies. In this study, in rats  receiving a high-fat diet (HFD), we analyzed the effects of a 4-wk daily  administration of a naturally occurring iodothyronine, 3,5-diiodo-L-thyronine (T2), on the gastrocnemius muscle metabolic/structural phenotype and insulin  signaling. The HFD-induced increases in muscle levels of fatty acid translocase  (3-fold; P<0.05) and TGs (2-fold, P<0.05) were prevented by T2 (each; P<0.05 vs. HFD).

Is selenium deficiency involved in autoimmune thyroid disease?,"Yes, selenium deficiency may play an important role in the initiation and progression of autoimmune thyroid disease."," Context:  CONTEXT: Selenium deficiency may play an important role in the initiation and  progression of autoimmune thyroid disease. OBJECTIVE: To compare serum selenium (s-Se) values in patients with newly diagnosed autoimmune thyroid disease and controls from the Danish population. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: S-Se was measured in triplicate by a fluorimetric method. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with newly diagnosed Graves' disease (GD) (n = 97) or autoimmune overt hypothyroidism (AIH) (n = 96), euthyroid subjects with high  serum levels of thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) (TPO-Ab > 1500 U/ml,  n = 92) and random controls (n = 830). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Differences in s-Se values.  ,  Context: In areas with severe selenium deficiency there is a higher incidence of  thyroiditis due to a decreased activity of selenium-dependent glutathione  peroxidase activity within thyroid cells. Selenium-dependent enzymes also have  several modifying effects on the immune system. Therefore, even mild selenium  deficiency may contribute to the development and maintenance of autoimmune  thyroid diseases. We performed a blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective study in female patients (n = 70; mean age, 47.5 +/- 0.7 yr) with autoimmune  thyroiditis and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and/or Tg antibodies  (TgAb) above 350 IU/ml.

Is ospemifene effective for treatment of dyspareunia?,"Ospemifene is effective for treating dyspareunia associated with postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy. It has been approved in the USA for this indication and has shown efficacy in clinical trials, increasing vaginal and uterine"," Context:  INTRODUCTION: Ospemifene, a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator, has  been developed for the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy and dyspareunia in  postmenopausal women. AIM: We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy  and safety of the drug for treating dyspareunia associated with postmenopausal  vulvar and vaginal atrophy. METHODS: A literature review was performed to identify all published randomized  double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of ospemifene for the treatment of  vulvovaginal atrophy and dyspareunia. The search included the following  ,  Context: OBJECTIVE: To characterize the pharmacokinetics of the oral, non-estrogen agent  ospemifene, an estrogen agonist/antagonist with tissue-selective effects (also  called a selective estrogen receptor modulator) that was recently approved for  the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy in  postmenopausal women. METHODS: Two open-label, Phase 1 studies were conducted to determine the  pharmacokinetics of ospemifene in healthy postmenopausal women. In the single-dose study, 60 mg of [3H]-ospemifene was orally administered to 6  subjects. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected predose and serially up  to 240 hours postdose. In the multiple-dose study, 12 subjects received 60 mg of ospemifene once daily for 9 days.

Supplemental hormonal therapies carry the  burden of a risk/benefit ratio that must be highly individualized. Selective  estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are estrogen receptor (ER)  agonist/antagonists designed to induce benefits comparable with estrogen while  minimizing adverse effects. Here, we review the estrogen agonist/antagonist  profile of ospemifene, a novel triphenylethylene derivative recently approved to  treat dyspareunia, a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) due to  menopause, both preclinically and clinically. Ospemifene binds ERα and ERβ with approximately equal affinities. In preclinical models, ospemifene increased  vaginal and uterine epithelial thickness and mucification to the same extent as  estrogen. Ospemifene did not induce endometrial hyperplasia in animal models; there also was no stimulatory effect on endometrial cells. In rat and human  mammary cells in vitro, ospemifene evokes a dose-dependent inhibition on  estrogen-induced cell responses and cell proliferation, supporting an  ,  Context: Ospemifene (Osphena™) is an oral selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM),  with tissue-specific estrogenic agonist/antagonist effects. QuatRx  Pharmaceuticals conducted the global development of the agent before licensing  it to Shionogi for regulatory filing and commercialization worldwide. Ospemifene  is the first non-estrogen treatment approved for moderate to severe dyspareunia  in women with menopause-related vulvar and vaginal atrophy. The drug is approved  in the USA, and application for EU regulatory approval is underway. This article  summarizes the milestones in the development of ospemifene leading to this first  approval for moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy.  ,  Context: vaginal atrophy, a chronic condition that affects up to 60% of postmenopausal  women. Ospemifene is the first and only nonestrogen compound approved for this  indication. Compared with other approved SERMs, such as tamoxifen, toremifene,  bazedoxifene, and raloxifene, the estrogen-like effects of ospemifene in the  vaginal epithelium are unique. This review first discusses the rationale for  developing ospemifene, including its mechanism of action, and then focuses on  the clinical development of ospemifene for the treatment of dyspareunia  associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy. Included are discussions of the  effects of ospemifene on the endometrium, serum lipids, coagulation markers, bone, and breast cancer. In conclusion, ospemifene is a SERM with a unique  estrogen agonist/antagonist tissue profile that was recently approved in the US  for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. Ospemifene warrants further clinical investigation for the  treatment and prevention of osteoporosis and breast cancer.

As such, chromatin organization plays a central role in establishing and  maintaining cell state during development, with gene regulation and genome  organization being mutually dependent effectors of cell identity.  ,  Context: The Mediator complex regulates transcription by connecting enhancers to  promoters. High Mediator binding density defines super enhancers, which regulate  cell-identity genes and oncogenes. Protein interactions of Mediator may explain  its role in these processes but have not been identified comprehensively. Here,  we purify Mediator from neural stem cells (NSCs) and identify 75 protein-protein  interaction partners. We identify super enhancers in NSCs and show that  Mediator-interacting chromatin modifiers colocalize with Mediator at enhancers  and super enhancers. Transcription factor families with high affinity for  Mediator dominate enhancers and super enhancers and can explain genome-wide Mediator localization. We identify E-box transcription factor Tcf4 as a key  regulator of NSCs. Tcf4 interacts with Mediator, colocalizes with Mediator at  super enhancers and regulates neurogenic transcription factor genes with super enhancers and broad H3K4me3 domains.

More research on colistin  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in critically ill patients and preterm  infants is needed to guide adequate colistin dosing at the least toxicity.
