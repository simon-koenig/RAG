What has happended in the year 399?,I don't know the answer.,"Context: evaluated. Aducanumab PK was characterized with a two-compartment model with  first-order elimination. No nonlinearities in PKs were observed. The PopPK-PD  model was developed using a sequential estimation approach. The time course of, Context: hospitals may already institute more robust staffing during this time,  preventing any significant increase in LOS. Multiple factors contribute to long  stays in the ED. While patients seen by residents stay longer in the ED, there, Context: We describe the use of intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue  plasminogen activator (IV-rtPA) in a patient with concomitant dabigatran use. A  64-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, pacemaker placement,, Context: several methods for the observation of GFP-tagged MPRs. Photobleaching the  peripheral region of a cell before a time-lapse observation allows us to monitor  TGN-derived transport carriers for longer periods (more than 4min). Events of, Context: transplantation were immunosuppression, the current issue at hand is organ  availability. Approximately 2500 heart transplants are done yearly, but the list  of candidates exceeds 50,000. What is perhaps even more alarming is the fact","34697913, 24578770, 22608344, 22264539, 15056065",Event 399 has happended in the year 399.,
What has happended in the year 400?,I don't know the answer. The context does not mention anything about the year 400.,"Context: several methods for the observation of GFP-tagged MPRs. Photobleaching the  peripheral region of a cell before a time-lapse observation allows us to monitor  TGN-derived transport carriers for longer periods (more than 4min). Events of, Context: METHODS: A Markov model was developed to predict patients' transitions across  health states defined by initial treatment (surgical resection followed by  adjuvant imatinib 400 milligrams [mg] daily versus surgical resection alone),, Context: accordance with its new labeled indication. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the budgetary impact over a 3-year time horizon of  treating patients with localized Kit-positive GIST with 1 year of adjuvant  imatinib following surgical resection., Context: upregulated during myeloid differentiation, and the corresponding protein,  pyrin, is expressed in the cytoplasm. (Blood. 2000;95:1451-1455), Context: transplantation in patients who have become resistant to these drugs.","22264539, 20726677, 20726677, 10666224, 16850123",Event 400 has happended in the year 400.,
