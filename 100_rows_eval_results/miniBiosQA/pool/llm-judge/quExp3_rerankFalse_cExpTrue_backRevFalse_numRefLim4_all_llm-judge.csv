Although more than 58 000 human lncRNA genes have been discovered, most known lncRNAs are still poorly characterized. One approach to understanding the functions of lncRNAs is the detection of the interacting RNA target of each lncRNA. Because experimental detections of comprehensive lncRNA-RNA interactions are difficult, computational prediction of lncRNA-RNA interactions is an indispensable technique. However, the high computational costs of existing RNA-RNA interaction prediction tools prevent their application to large-scale lncRNA datasets. 'RIblast' is an ultrafast RNA-RNA interaction prediction method based on the seed-and-extension approach. RIblast discovers seed regions using suffix arrays and subsequently extends seed regions based on an RNA secondary structure energy model. Computational experiments indicate that RIblast achieves a level of prediction accuracy similar to those of existing programs, but at speeds over 64 times faster than existing programs.",28459942,5.0,[5. 5. 1. 5.],[5. 5. 5. 5.],5.0

Gene therapy is a treatment option that introduces genetic material in vivo or ex vivo into the cells of an affected organism in order to: exchange a defective gene; manipulate a disease-related gene; or introduce an additional gene copy for overexpression of the encoded protein to generate a curative biological effect. Somatic gene therapy is gene transfer by a specific vector to a somatic cell; in contrast to germline gene therapy, the modification of the cell is restricted to the recipient and cannot be passed to her/his progeny. High efficiency of gene transfer, high specificity for the target cells, long-lasting expression of the transgene and safety without adverse reactions are the desired characteristics of an ideal vector for gene transfer. Retroviral (gretroviral and lentiviral) vectors have now been used in more than 350 gene-therapy studies. Retroviral vectors are particularly suited for gene-correction of cells due to long-term and stable expression of the transferred transgene(s), and also because little effort is required for their cloning and production. Several monogenic inherited diseases, mostly immunodeficiencies, can now be successfully treated.","24120896, 16251873, 12686720, 23921576, 15912200, 23843498, 23884859, 19435468, 23845071, 23860311, 23845947, 23845948, 21943326",5.0,[2. 5. 2. 5.],[5. 5. 5. 5.],5.0
